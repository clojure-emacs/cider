;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provides an Emacs Lisp client to connect to Clojure nREPL servers.
;;
;; A connection is an abstract idea of the communication between Emacs (client)
;; and nREPL server.  On Emacs side connections are represented by two running
;; processes.  The two processes are the server process and client process.  Each
;; of these is represented by it's own process buffer, filter and sentinel.
;;
;; The nREPL communication process can be broadly represented as follows:
;;
;;    1) Server process is started as an Emacs subprocess (usually by
;;      `cider-jack-in')
;;
;;    2) Server's process filter (`nrepl-server-filter') detects the connection
;;       port from the first plain text response from server and starts
;;       communication process as another Emacs subprocess.  This is the nREPL
;;       client process (`nrepl-client-filter').  All requests and responses
;;       handling happen through this client connection.
;;
;;    3) Requests are sent by `nrepl-send-request' and
;;       `nrepl-send-sync-request'.  Request is simply a list containing a
;;       requested operation name and the parameters required by the
;;       operation.  Each request has an associated callback that is called once
;;       the response for the request has arrived.  Besides the above functions
;;       there are specialized request senders for each type of common
;;       operations.  Examples are `nrepl-request:eval', `nrepl-request:clone',
;;       `nrepl-request:describe'.
;;
;;    4) Responses from the server are decoded in `nrepl-client-filter' and are
;;       physically represented by alists whose structure depends on the type of
;;       the response.  After having been decoded, the data from the response is
;;       passed over to the callback that was registered by the original
;;       request.
;;
;; Please see the comments in dedicated sections of this file for more detailed
;; description.

The presence of a particular key determines the type of the response.  For
