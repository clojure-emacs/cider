  "Format the contents of the given region.

START and END represent the region's boundaries.

FORMATTER is a function of one argument which is used to convert
the string contents of the region into a formatted string.

Uses the following heuristic to try to maintain point position:

- Take a snippet of text starting at current position, up to 64 chars.
- Search for the snippet, with lax whitespace, in the formatted text.
  - If snippet is less than 64 chars (point was near end of buffer), search
    from end instead of beginning.
- Place point at match beginning, or `point-min' if no match."
