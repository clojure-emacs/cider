;;; Commentary:

;; This is a script to be loaded while visiting a CIDER source file.  It will
;; prepare all requirements and then byte-compile the file and signal an error
;; on any warning.  For example:
;;
;;    emacs -Q --batch -l test/cider-bytecomp-warnings.el cider-mode.el

;; This assumes that all CIDER dependencies are already on the package dir
;; (probably from running `cask install').
