(defmacro nrepl-tests-log/init! (enable? name log-filename &optional clean?)
  "When ENABLE? is true, create a NAME/log! elisp function to log messages to LOG-FILENAME,
taking the same arguments as `message'. Messages are appended to
LOG-FILENAME, beginning with a :timestamp and followed up with :NAME. When
CLEAN? is true remove LOG-FILENAME.

If ENABLE? is nil, NAME/log! function is a nil macro discarding all
arguments unevaluated.

This logger fn is written in mind with multiple processes writing to the
the same file, each having a unique name, in order to capture the order of
events (e.g. a nREPL client process and mock server process writing to the
same file).
