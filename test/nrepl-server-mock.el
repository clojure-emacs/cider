;;; Commentary:

;; This file is part of CIDER
;;
;; A mock nREPL server that sends dummy replies back to clients with just enough
;; information onboard to accommodate testing requirements.
;;
;; Meant to be invoked as the top-level fn of an Emacs subprocess.

;;; Code:

(require 'nrepl-client)
(require 'nrepl-tests-utils "test/utils/nrepl-tests-utils")
(require 'queue)
(require 'cl)

(defun nrepl-server-mock--get-keys (dict keys)
  "Get the values for KEYS from nrepl-dict DICT.
Get them as a list, so they can be easily consumed by
`cl-destructuring-bind`."
  (mapcar (lambda (k) (nrepl-dict-get dict k)) keys))

(defun nrepl-server-mock-filter (proc output)
  "Handle the nREPL message found in OUTPUT sent by the client PROC.
Minimal implementation, just enough for fulfilling clients' testing
requirements.

Additional complexity is added by the fact that bencoded dictionaries
must have their keys in sorted order.  But we don't want to have to
remember to write them down as such in the test values here (because
there is ample room for mistakes that are harder to debug)."
