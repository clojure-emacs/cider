;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains tests for CIDER that require an active nREPL connection
;; with `cider-nrepl' middleware, and can't currently be included in automated
;; CI builds.

;; To run these tests:
;;   All tests: M-x buttercup-run-at-point
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'buttercup)
(require 'cider)
(require 'cider-compat)
(require 'cl-lib)

;;; Docs
;; Presenting docs erroneously would cause an ugly scene.
