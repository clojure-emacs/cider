# Changelog

## 0.2.0

* <kbd>C-c M-d</kbd> will display current nREPL connection details.
* <kbd>C-c M-r</kbd> will rotate and display the current nREPL connection.
* Setting the variable `nrepl-buffer-name-show-port` will display the port on which the nRepl server is running.
* nRepl buffer name uses project directory name; `*nrepl*` will appear as `*nrepl project-directory-name*`.
* <kbd>C-c C-Z</kbd> will select the nrepl buffer based on the current namespace.
* <kbd>C-u C-c C-Z</kbd> will select the nrepl buffer based on a user project directory prompt.

### Bugs fixed

* <kbd>C-c M-s</kbd> (`nrepl-selector`) was bound to non-existing symbol.

## 0.1.8 / 2013-08-08

### New features

* Evaluate all namespace forms `(ns ...)` in the user namespace.
* Add highlighting of compilation warnings in addition to existing highlighting of errors
* Add support for selecting last Clojure source buffer with keybinding
<kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> (the same as `nrepl-switch-to-repl-buffer`).
* The content of `target/repl-port`, if present, will be used as the
  default port for <kbd>M-x nrepl</kbd>
* Added an extendable slime-style selector command and binding <kbd>C-c M-s</kbd>

### Bugs fixed

* <kbd>M-.</kbd> (`nrepl-jump`) on remote nrepl connection (across OS hosts) has been fixed.

## 0.1.7 / 2013-03-13

### New features

* Add support for multiple nrepl sessions.  A single session is closed with
  `M-x nrepl-close`.  A repl session is made default with
  `M-x nrepl-make-repl-connection-default`.
* Added support for pretty-printing in the REPL buffer.
* Added a check for the presence of an existing `*nrepl*` buffer before
creating a new one with `nrepl-jack-in` or `nrepl`.
* `M-.` learned about namespaces.
* Added new customization variable `nrepl-popup-stacktraces-in-repl`.
* Added some convenience keybindings to `clojure-mode` -
`nrepl-jack-in` is now bound to <kbd>C-c M-j</kbd> and `nrepl` is
bound to <kbd>C-c M-c</kbd>.
* Added `nrepl-hide-special-buffers` setting to control the display of special
buffers like `*nrepl-server*` and `*nrepl-connection*`.
* Apply ANSI color codes to output sent to nrepl buffers.
* Add a connection browser `nrepl-connection-browser` to allow control of
  multiple connections.
* Add macroexpand key bindings to `nrepl-mode-map`.
* Don't suppress namespaces in macroexpansion.
* Add explicit require of expected namespaces in the repl buffer.
* Add command `nrepl-pprint-eval-last-expression`.
* Add an event buffer for debugging.
* Allow connections without repl buffers.
* Add hook `nrepl-file-loaded-hook` which runs on load-file
  completion.
* Expand ido-completion to include "used" variables in addition to
  "interned" variables.
