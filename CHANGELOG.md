## 0.8.0 / 2014-11-20

### New features

* `cider-auto-jump-to-error` accepts new option `'errors-only`
* `cider-connect` now asks for remote hosts defined in machine-wide `ssh`
  configuration files and automatically detects running instances of lein
  server, both on local and remote machines.

  pretty printing an exception cause's data.  Defaults to 50.
* New interactive command `cider-undef`.
* New interactive command `cider-clear-compilation-highlights`.
* First pass at a CIDER quick reference card.
* `completion-at-point` now annotates functions, macros and special forms, thus making it
simpler to gain understanding of what you're using (disabled by default).

* New vars: `cider-to-nrepl-filename-function` and `cider-from-nrepl-filename-function`
are used to translate filenames from/to the nREPL server (default Cygwin implementation provided).
* Java classpath browser (`M-x cider-classpath`).

the current ns with `C-u C-c ,`.

### Changes

* bencode decoder was rewritten:
  - nREPL dicts are now plists and accessor api is given by `nrepl-dict-p`,
    `nrepl-dict-get` and `nrepl-dict-put`.
  - nested stack is used for decoded messages to avoid re-parsing of incomplete messages
  - queues are used for incoming strings from the server and for the decoded responses
* REPL buffers are now connection buffers for REPL client connections.
* Server and client cranking were isolated into `nrepl-start-server-process` and
  `nrepl-start-client-process`.

* nrepl-client.el refactoring:

  - `nrepl-send-request-sync` was renamed into `nrepl-send-sync-request` to comply
  -  with the names of other 'sync' variables.

  - nREPL requests are now named with `nrepl-request:OP` where "OP" stands for
    the type of the request (eval, clone etc.). The following functions
    were renamed:

       `nrepl-send-string` -> `nrepl-request:eval`
       `nrepl-send-string-sync` -> `nrepl-sync-request:eval`
       `nrepl-send-interrupt` -> `nrepl-request:interrupt`
       `nrepl-send-stdin` -> `nrepl-request:stdin`
       `nrepl-describe-session` -> `nrepl-request:describe`
       `nrepl-create-client-session` -> `nrepl-request:clone`

* Renamed `cider-macroexpansion-suppress-namespaces` to `cider-macroexpansion-display-namespaces`.

an error message is displayed in the minibuffer.
* [#719](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/719) The customization
variable `cider-test-show-report-on-success` controls now, whether to show the
`*cider-test-report*` buffer on passing tests. The default is to not show the
buffer.
* Renamed `cider-toggle-trace` to `cider-toggle-trace-var` and remapped it to <kbd>C-c M-t v</kbd>.

### Bugs fixed
