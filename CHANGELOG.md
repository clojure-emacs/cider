# Changelog

## master (unreleased)

### New Features

* Add an option `nrepl-prompt-to-kill-server-buffer-on-quit` to control whether killing nREPL server buffer and process requires a confirmation prompt.
* [#1672](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1672): Allow setting a preferred build tool when multiple are found via `cider-preferred-build-tool`.
* Ensure Clojure version meets minimum supported by CIDER (1.7.0).
* Fringe indicators highlight which sexps have been loaded. Disable it with `cider-use-fringe-indicators`.
* New command: `cider-inspect-last-result`.
* `cider-cljs-lein-repl` now also supports figwheel.
* Option `cider-jack-in-auto-inject-clojure` enables the user to specify a
  version of Clojure for CIDER. This allows the user to override the version
  used in a project, particular if it is lower than minimum required for CIDER.
* Allow the ns displayed by eldoc to be tailored via `cider-eldoc-ns-function`.
* After connecting a ClojureScript REPL, CIDER will try to figure out if it's being served on a port and will offer to open it in a browser.
* [#1720](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1720): Add a command `cider-eval-sexp-at-point` to evaluate the form around point (bound to `C-c C-v v`).
* [#1564](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1564): CIDER's internal namespaces and vars are filtered from the ns-browser and apropos functions.
* [#1725](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1725): Display class names in eldoc for interop forms.
* [#1572](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1572): Add support for variables in eldoc.
* [#1736](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1736): Show "See Also" links for functions/variables in documentation buffers.

### Changes

* Simpler keybindings in macroexpand buffer. Expand one step with `m` and all expansions with `a`. Previously was `C-c C-m` and `C-c M-m`.
* Signal an error sooner if the user misconfigured `cider-known-endpoints`.
* `cider-inspect-read-and-inspect` is obsolete. Use `cider-inspect-expression` instead.
* Extremely long overlays are truncated and `cider-inspect-last-result` is recommended.
* Signal `user-error` instead of `error` on jack-in if a project type is not supported.
* Users with `boot.sh` instead of `boot` should customize `cider-boot-command` instead of relying on automatic detection.
* [#1737](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1737): Show value of locals in debugger tooltip.
* Rebind `cider-eval-last-sexp-and-replace` to `C-c C-v w`.
* Rebind `cider-eval-region` to `C-c C-v r`.
* Rebind `cider-eval-ns-form` to `C-c C-v n`.
* [#1577](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1577): Show first line of docstring in ns browser.

### Bugs fixed

* [#1712](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1712): Bad compilation issue caused when installed along with `nim-mode`.
* Fix arglist display for `def` in the doc buffer.
* Use `cider-apropos-select` instead of `cider-apropos` in `cider-apropos-documentation-select`.
* [#1561](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1561): Use an appropriate font-lock-face for variables, macros and functions in
the ns-browser.
* [#1708](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1708): Fix `cider-popup-buffer-display` when another frame is used for the error buffer.
* [#1733](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1733): Better error handling when no boot command is found in exec-path.

## 0.12.0 (2016-04-16)

### New Features

* Option `cider-use-tooltips` controls the display of mouse-over tooltips.
* `f` key reruns failed tests on the test-report buffer.
* `g` key reruns test at point on the test-report buffer.
* Debugger now supports step-in.
* Improve CIDER's menu-bar menu:
  - Thoroughly reorganize it and split it into 3 separate menus;
  - Add custom-written `:help` strings to some items, and automatically add help strings to the rest;
  - Add a few commands;
  - Grey-out commands that rely on connections while there is no connection.
* Var docstrings are automatically displayed in mouse-over tooltips.
* [#1636](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1636): New minor-mode `cider-auto-test-mode` for test-driven-development. When activated, tests are rerun after every load-file.
* Javadoc commands take into account the variable `clojure.java.javadoc/*remote-javadocs*`.
* Javadoc also works on classes of the AmazonAWS Java SDK.
* Apropos commands now accept lists of space-separated words as arguments, in addition to regular expressions (similar to Emacs's own apropos commands).
* [#1541](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1541): New commands `cider-apropos-select` (bound to `C-c C-d C-s`) and `cider-apropos-documentation-select` (bound to `C-c C-d c-e`).
* New function `cider-expected-ns` is like `clojure-expected-ns`, but uses classpath for better results.  See [clojure-mode#372](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode/issues/372).
* A double prefix argument (`C-u C-u`) for `cider-eval-defun-at-point` debugs the sexp at point instead of the entire defun, and offers to create a conditional breakpoint.
* New command `cider-load-all-project-ns` allows you to load all project namespaces.
* Display eldoc for keywords used to get map keys.
* Display eldoc for `Classname.`.
* Display namespace in eldoc.

### Changes

* Doc buffer splits arglists into several lines.
* Changed the face of the words “Macro” and “Special form” in the doc buffer to be easier to see.
* Display multi-line eval overlays at the start of the following line. It looked weird that these overlays started on the middle of a line, but then folded onto the start of following lines.
* [#1627](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1627): Align the terminology used by `cider-test` with the one used by lein and boot (use the terms `assertion` and `test`).
* Remove the warning about missing nREPl ops.
* [#1420](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1420): Show stacktrace buffers for sync requests errors.

* [#1632](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1632): Redefining a function correctly updates eldoc.
* [#1630](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1630): The debugger no longer gets confused inside `@` redefs.
* [#1599](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1599): Don't error when test makes 0 assertions.
* [#1563](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1563): Handle invalid regular expressions in apropos.
* [#1625](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1625): Display a more meaningful message when running
an individual test using `C-c C-t t`.
* Fix buffer closing in `cider-close-ancillary-buffers`.
* Dynamic font-locking is also refreshed when a file's namespace depends on a namespace that was changed, so the traced-face should be immediately updated even on functions from another namespace.
* [#1656](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1656): Apply ansi colors to output when doing eval and print.

## 0.11.0 (2016-03-03)

### New features

* [#1545](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1545): New feature: Enlighten. See the new Readme section for more information.

* Change default value of `cider-overlays-use-font-lock` to `t`. Unlike before, a value of `t`, causes `cider-result-overlay-face` is to be prepended to the font-lock faces (instead of just not being used).
* `cider-result-overlay-face` default value changed to a background and a box, so it can be prepended to other faces without overriding the foreground.
* [#1518](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1518): Add `cider-dynamic-indentation` defcustom, to disable dynamic indent functionality.
* Font-lock traced vars.
* New defcustom, `cider-pprint-fn`, allows you to set the function to use when pretty-printing evaluation results.
* [#1432](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1432): Show explicit error messages when invoking commands with no ClojureScript support.
* [#1463](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1463): Assume that `cider-connect` is invoked from within a project,
and try to associate the created connection with this project automatically.
* Typing `s` in a debug session shows the current stack.
* Typing `h` (as in *h*ere) skips all sexps until the current point position.
* [#1507](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1507): Add the ability to control the REPL's scroll on output functionality via `cider-repl-scroll-on-output`.
* [#1543](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1543): Add some getting started instructions to the welcome banner.
* New command `cider-drink-a-sip`. Use in case you're thirsty for knowledge.

* New command `cider-repl-clear-banners`.
* New command `cider-repl-clear-help-banner`.

### Changes

* [#1531](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1531) `cider-jack-in` now injects its own dependencies using CLI. Both leiningen and boot are supported. Set `cider-inject-dependencies-at-jack-in` to nil to opt out. Extension point for other tools to inject their own dependencies is `cider-add-repl-dependencies`.
* `cider-inspect` now operates by default on the last sexp. Its behavior can be altered via prefix arguments.
* Requires Clojure(Script) 1.7 or newer.
* Requires Java 7 or newer.
* Improve stacktrace presentation of compiler errors (readability, DWIM point positioning).
* [#1458](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1458): Separate nREPL messages by connections instead of by sessions.
* [#1226](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1226): Enable running of all loaded and all project tests.
* Give test commands their own keybinding prefix (`C-c C-t`). Use both single-key and
  `Control` + letter mnemonics for these commands (as for the documentation
  commands).
* `cider-test` commands now have keybindings in `cider-repl-mode`. The keybindings are exactly the same as those in `cider-mode`.
* Changed the binding of `cider-apropos-documentation` to `C-c C-d f` and `C-c C-d C-f` (it was `C-c C-d A`).
* [#1584](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1584): Don't enable `eldoc-mode` automatically in `cider-repl-mode`.
* [#1585](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1585): Show the eval command in the debugger's prompt.

* [#1373](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1373): Add gradle support for `cider-jack-in`.
* Indentation of macros (and functions) [can be specified](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider#specifying-indentation) in the var's metadata, via [indent specs](indent_spec.md).
* [Abbreviated printing](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/pull/268) for functions multimethods. Instead of seeing `#object[clojure.core$_PLUS_ 0x4e648e99 "clojure.core$_PLUS_@4e648e99"]` you'll see `#function[clojure.core/+]`.
* [#1376](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1376): Anything printed to `*out*` outside an eval scope is also forwarded to all nREPL sessions connected from CIDER. Normally it would only be sent to the server's `out`.

* [#1191](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1191): New custom variables `cider-debug-print-level` and `cider-debug-print-length`.
* [#1188](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1188): New debugging tool-bar.
* [#1187](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1187): The list of keys displayed by the debugger can be configured with `cider-debug-prompt`.
* [#1187](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1187): While debugging, there is a menu on the menu-bar listing available commands.
* [#1184](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1184): When the user kills the repl buffer, CIDER will offer to kill the nrepl buffer and process too. Also, when the client (repl) process dies, the server (nrepl) process is killed too.

* [#1241](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1241): Passing a double prefix argument to `cider-refresh` will now clear the state of the namespace tracker used by the refresh middleware. This is useful for recovering from errors that a normal reload would not otherwise recover from, but may cause stale code in any deleted files to not be completely unloaded.
* New defcustom `cider-result-use-clojure-font-lock` allows you disable the use of Clojure font-locking for interactive results.
* [#1239](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1239): New defcustom `cider-refresh-show-log-buffer`, controls the behaviour of the `*cider-refresh-log*` buffer when calling `cider-refresh`. When set to nil (the default), the log buffer will still be written to, but not displayed automatically. Instead, the most relevant information will be displayed in the echo area. When set to non-nil, the log buffer will be displayed every time `cider-refresh` is called.
* [#1328](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1328): Auto-scroll the `*nrepl-server*` buffer on new output.
* [#1300](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1300): Add the ability to replicate an existing connection with `cider-replicate-connection`.

* [#1337](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1337): Added a command to switch between the Clojure and ClojureScript REPLs in the same project (bound to <kbd>C-c M-o</kbd> in `cider-repl-mode`).

### Changes

* [#1299](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1299) <kbd>C-c C-k</kbd> and <kbd> C-c C-l</kbd> now dispatch to both the Clojure and ClojureScript REPL (in the same project) when called from a `.cljc` or `.cljx` file.
* [#1397](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1297) <kbd>C-c M-n</kbd> now changes the ns of both the Clojure and ClojureScript REPL (in the same project) when called from a cljc or cljx file.
* [#1348](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1348): Drop the dash dependency.
* The usage of the default connection has been reduced significantly. Now evaluations & related commands will be routed via the connection matching the current project automatically unless there's some ambiguity when determining the connection (like multiple or no matching connections). Simply put you'll no longer have to mess around much with connecting-setting commands (e.g. `nrepl-connection-browser`, `cider-rotate-default-connection`).
* [#732](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/732): `cider-quit` and `cider-restart` now operate on the current connection only. With a prefix argument they operate on all connections.
* `nrepl-log-messages` is now set to `t` by default.
* Renamed `cider-repl-output-face` to `cider-repl-stdout-face` and `cider-repl-err-output-face` to `cider-repl-stderr-face`.
* Clearing the REPL buffer is now bound to `C-u C-C C-o`.
* [#1422](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1422): Don't display mismatching parens error on incomplete expressions in REPL buffers.
* [#1412](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1412): nREPL messages for separate sessions are tracked in separate buffers.
* Removed `cider-switch-to-repl-command`.

### Bugs fixed

* [#1384](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1384): Match windows file names in `cider-compilation-regexp`.
* [#1252](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1252) `cider-repl-clear-buffer` stops working in certain circumstances.
* [#1164](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/pull/1164): Fix an error in `cider-browse-ns--doc-at-point`.
* [#1189](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1189): Don't show result from automatic ns form evaluation.
* [#1079](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1079): Don't try to font-lock very long results. The maximum font-lockable result length is controlled by `cider-font-lock-max-length`.

## 0.9.1 (2015-06-24)

* Added some convenience keybindings to `clojure-mode` -
`nrepl-jack-in` is now bound to <kbd>C-c M-j</kbd> and `nrepl` is
bound to <kbd>C-c M-c</kbd>.
