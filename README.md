# CIDER (formerly nrepl.el)

`CIDER` is Clojure IDE and REPL for Emacs, built on top of
[nREPL](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl), the Clojure networked
REPL server. It's a great alternative to the now deprecated combination
of SLIME + [swank-clojure](https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure).

## Installation

#### Upgrading from nrepl.el

Before installing CIDER make sure you've removed the old `nrepl.el`
package and all packages that depend on it. Use only packages updated to work with CIDER!

You'll also need to adjust your config accordingly, as most settings
were renamed in CIDER. Consult the **Configuration** section of the
README for more details.

### Via package.el

`package.el` is the built-in package manager in Emacs 24+. On Emacs 23
you will need to get [package.el](http://bit.ly/pkg-el23) yourself if you wish to use it.

`CIDER` is available on both major `package.el` community
maintained repos -
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/cider) and
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net).

If you're not already using one of them, follow their installation instructions:
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/),
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/getting-started).

You can install `CIDER` with the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] cider [RET]</kbd>

or by adding this bit of Emacs Lisp code to your Emacs initialization file(`.emacs` or `init.el`):

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'cider)
  (package-install 'cider))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents [RET]</kbd>

Keep in mind that MELPA packages are built automatically from
the `master` branch, meaning bugs might creep in there from time to
time. Never-the-less, installing from MELPA is the recommended way of
obtaining CIDER, as the `master` branch is normally quite stable and
"stable" (tagged) builds are released somewhat infrequently.

### Via el-get

[el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) is another popular package manager for Emacs.
If you're an el-get user just do <kbd>M-x el-get-install</kbd>.

### Manual

You can install `CIDER` manually by placing `CIDER` on your `load-path`
and `require`ing it. Many people favour the folder `~/.emacs.d/vendor`:

```el
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/vendor")
(require 'cider)
```

Keep in mind that `CIDER` depends on `clojure-mode`, `dash.el` and
`pkg-info` so you'll have to install them as well.

### Emacs Prelude

`CIDER` comes bundled in
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). If you're a
Prelude user you can start using it right away.

### Emacs Live

`CIDER` comes bundled in
[Emacs Live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live). If you're using
Emacs Live you're already good to go.

## Configuration

You can certainly use `CIDER` without configuring it any further,
but here are some ways other folks are adjusting their `CIDER`
experience.

* Enable `eldoc` in Clojure buffers:

```el
(add-hook 'cider-mode-hook 'cider-turn-on-eldoc-mode)
```

* You can hide the `*nrepl-connection*` and `*nrepl-server*` buffers
from appearing in some buffer switching commands like
`switch-to-buffer`(<kbd>C-x b</kbd>) like this:

```el
(setq nrepl-hide-special-buffers t)
```

When using `switch-to-buffer`, pressing <kbd>SPC</kbd> after the command will
make the hidden buffers visible. They'll always be visible in
`list-buffers` (<kbd>C-x C-b</kbd>).

* You can control the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key behavior in the REPL via the
`cider-repl-tab-command` variable.  While the default command
`cider-repl-indent-and-complete-symbol` should be an adequate choice for
most users, it's very easy to switch to another command if you wish
to. For instance if you'd like <kbd>TAB</kbd> to only indent (maybe
because you're used to completing with <kbd>M-TAB</kbd>) use the
following snippet:

```el
(setq cider-repl-tab-command 'indent-for-tab-command)
```

* Prevent the auto-display of the REPL buffer in a separate window
  after connection is established:

```el
(setq cider-repl-pop-to-buffer-on-connect nil)
```

* Stop the error buffer from popping up while working in buffers other
than the REPL:

```el
(setq cider-popup-stacktraces nil)
```

* Enable error buffer popping also in the REPL:

```el
(setq cider-repl-popup-stacktraces t)
```

* To auto-select the error buffer when it's displayed:

```el
(setq cider-auto-select-error-buffer t)
```

* The REPL buffer name takes the format `*cider project-name*`.
Change the separator from space to something else by overriding `nrepl-buffer-name-separator`.

```el
(setq nrepl-buffer-name-separator "-")
```

* The REPL buffer name can also display the port on which the nREPL server is running.
Buffer name will look like *cider project-name:port*.

```el
(setq nrepl-buffer-name-show-port t)
```

* Make <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> switch to the CIDER REPL buffer in the current window:

```el
(setq cider-repl-display-in-current-window t)
```

### REPL History

* To make the REPL history wrap around when its end is reached:

```el
(setq cider-repl-wrap-history t)
```

* To adjust the maximum number of items kept in the REPL history:

```el
(setq cider-repl-history-size 1000) ; the default is 500
```

* To store the REPL history in a file:

```el
(setq cider-repl-history-file "path/to/file")
```

Note that the history is written to the file when you kill the REPL
buffer (which includes invoking `cider-quit`) or you quit Emacs.

### Integration with other modes

* Enabling `CamelCase` support for editing commands(like
`forward-word`, `backward-word`, etc) in the REPL is quite useful since
we often have to deal with Java class and method names. The built-in
Emacs minor mode `subword-mode` provides such functionality:

```el
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook 'subword-mode)
```

* The use of [paredit](http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.html)
when editing Clojure (or any other Lisp) code is highly
recommended.  You're probably using it already in your `clojure-mode`
buffers (if you're not you probably should). You might also want to
enable `paredit` in the REPL buffer as well:

```el
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook 'paredit-mode)
```

* [smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens) is an excellent
  alternative to paredit. Many Clojure hackers have adopted it
  recently and you might want to give it a try as well. To enable
  `smartparens` in the REPL buffer use the following code:

```el
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook 'smartparens-strict-mode)
```

* [RainbowDelimiters](https://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters) is a
  minor mode which highlights parentheses, brackets, and braces
  according to their depth. Each successive level is highlighted in a
  different color. This makes it easy to spot matching delimiters,
  orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a
  given depth. Assuming you've already installed RainbowDelimiters you can
  enable it in the REPL like this:

```el
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
```

* [ac-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/ac-nrepl) provides
  completion source for the popular Emacs interactive auto-completion
  framework [auto-complete](http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/).
  Where nREPL provides it, pop-up documentation for completed symbols
  will be displayed.

## Basic Usage

The only requirement to use CIDER is to have a nREPL server to
which it may connect. Many Clojurians favour the use of the Leiningen tool
to start a nREPL server, but the use of Leiningen is not a prerequisite to use
CIDER (but it's required if you want to use the `cider-jack-in` command).

### Setting up a Leiningen project (optional)

[Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) is the de facto standard
build/project management tool for Clojure.  It has a similar scope to
the Maven build tool favoured by Java developers (Leiningen actually
reuses many things from the Maven ecosystem).

CIDER features a command called `cider-jack-in` that will start an nREPL server
for a particular Leiningen project and connect to it automatically.
This functionality depends on Leiningen 2. Older versions are not supported. Follow
the installation instructions on Leiningen's web site to get it up and running and afterwards
create a project like this:

```
$ lein new demo
```

The two main ways to obtain an nREPL connection are discussed in the following sections of the manual.

### Launch a nREPL server and client from Emacs

Simply open in Emacs a file belonging to your `lein` project (like
`foo.clj`) and type <kbd>M-x cider-jack-in</kbd>. This will start a nREPL with
all the deps loaded in, plus an `CIDER` client connected to it.

Alternative you can use <kbd>C-u M-x cider-jack-in</kbd> to specify the name of
a lein project, without having to visit any file in it.

### Connect to a running nREPL server

You can go to your project's dir in a terminal and type there
(assuming you're using Leiningen that is):

```
$ lein repl
```

Alternatively you can start nREPL either manually or by the facilities provided by your
project build tool (Maven, etc).

After you get your nREPL server running go back to Emacs.
Typing there <kbd>M-x cider</kbd> will allow you to connect to the running nREPL server.

### Using the cider minor mode

`CIDER` comes with a handy minor mode called `cider-mode` (complementing
`clojure-mode`) that allows you to evaluate code in your Clojure source
files and load it directly in the REPL.  A list of all
available commands is available in the `CIDER` menu and in the following
section of this manual.

### Pretty printing in the REPL

Make the REPL always pretty-print the results of your commands. Note
that this will not work correctly with forms such as `(def a 1) (def b2)`
and it expects `clojure.pprint` to have been required already
(the default in more recent versions of Clojure):

<kbd>M-x cider-toggle-pretty-printing</kbd>

## Keyboard shortcuts

* <kbd>M-x cider-jack-in</kbd>: Launch an nREPL server and a REPL client.
    Prompts for a project root if given a prefix argument.
* <kbd>M-x cider</kbd>: Connect to an already-running nREPL server.

While you're in `clojure-mode`, `cider-jack-in` is bound for
convenience to <kbd>C-c M-j</kbd> and `cider` is bound to <kbd>C-c
M-c</kbd>.

The character used to trigger the shortcuts is configurable via `cider-repl-shortcut-dispatch-char`. Here's how you can change it to `:`:

```el
(setq cider-repl-shortcut-dispatch-char ?\:)
```

### cider-macroexpansion-minor-mode

<kbd>g</kbd>                    | The prior macroexpansion is performed again and the current contents of the macroexpansion buffer are replaced with the new expansion.
<kbd>C-/</kbd> <kbd>C-x u</kbd> | Undo the last inplace expansion performed in the macroexpansion buffer.

### Managing multiple sessions

You can connect to multiple nREPL servers and use <kbd>M-x cider-jack-in</kbd> multiple
times.  To close a single nREPL session, use <kbd>M-x nrepl-close</kbd>.  <kbd>M-x
cider-quit</kbd> closes all sessions.

CIDER commands in a Clojure buffer use the default connection.  To make a
connection default, switch to it's REPL buffer and use
<kbd>M-x nrepl-make-repl-connection-default</kbd>.

To switch to the relevant REPL buffer based on the Clojure namespace in the current buffer, use: <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd>.

You can display the current nREPL connection using <kbd>C-c M-d</kbd> and rotate through available connections using <kbd>C-c M-r</kbd>.

## Requirements

* [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) 2.x (only for `cider-jack-in`)
* [GNU Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) 23.2+ or 24.
* [Clojure](http://clojure.org) 1.4.0+

## Changelog

An extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## Extensions & Related projects

There are a couple of CIDER extensions that add some extra functionality to it:

* [cider-tracing](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-tracing) adds basic tracing support
* [cider-decompile](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-decompile) adds some Java bytecode decompilation commands
* [troncle](https://github.com/coventry/troncle) adds advanced tracing support. If you don't mind installing some extra nREPL middleware
you should use it instead of `cider-tracing`.
