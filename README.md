# nrepl.el

`nrepl.el` is an Emacs client for
[nREPL](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl), the Clojure networked
REPL server. It's a great alternative to the now deprecated combination
of SLIME + [swank-clojure](https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure).

## Installation

### Via package.el

`package.el` is the built-in package manager in Emacs 24+. On Emacs 23
you will need to get [package.el](http://bit.ly/pkg-el23) yourself if you wish to use it.

`nrepl.el` is available on the both [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/nrepl)
and [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net) repos.

If you're not already using Marmalade, add this to your
`~/.emacs.d/init.el` and load it with `M-x eval-buffer`.

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
```

For MELPA the code you need to add is:

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
```

And then you can install:

`M-x package-install [RET] nrepl [RET]`

or

```lisp
(when (not (package-installed-p 'nrepl))
  (package-install 'nrepl))
```

If installation doesn't work try refreshing package list first:

`M-x package-refresh-contents [RET]`

### Via el-get

[el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get) is another popular package manager for Emacs.
If you're an el-get user just do `M-x el-get-install`.

### Manual

You can install `nrepl.el` manually by placing `nrepl.el` on your `load-path`
and `require`ing it. Many people favour the folder `~/.emacs.d/vendor`:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/vendor")
(require 'nrepl)
```

Keep in mind that `nrepl.el` depends on `clojure-mode` so you'll have to install
`clojure-mode` as well.

### Emacs Prelude

`nrepl.el` is comes bundled with
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). If you're a
Prelude user you can start using it right away.

## Configuration

You can certainly use `nrepl.el` without configuring it any further,
but here are some ways other folks are adjusting their `nrepl.el`
experience.

* Enable eldoc in clojure buffers:

```lisp
(add-hook 'nrepl-interaction-mode-hook
  'nrepl-turn-on-eldoc-mode)
```

* Stop the error buffer from popping up while working in the REPL
buffer:

```lisp
(setq nrepl-popup-stacktraces nil)
```

* Make **C-c C-z** switch to the `*nrepl*` buffer in the current window:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'same-window-buffer-names "*nrepl*") 
```

* If you have
  [paredit](http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.html) installed
  you can enabled it like this:

```lisp
(add-hook 'nrepl-interaction-mode 'paredit-mode)
```

## Basic Usage

### Launch a nrepl server and client from Emacs

Simply open in Emacs a file belonging to your `lein` project (like
`foo.clj`) and you type `M-x nrepl-jack-in`. This will start a nREPL with
all the deps loaded in, plus an `nrepl.el` client connected to it.

Alternative you can use `C-u M-x nrepl-jack-in` to specify the name of
a lein project, without having to visit any file in it.

### Connect to a running nrepl server

You can go to your project's dir in a terminal and type there:

```bash
$ lein repl
```

Afterwards typing `M-x nrepl` will allow you to connect to the running nrepl session.

### Using the nrepl minor mode

`nrepl.el` comes with a handy minor mode (complementing
`clojure-mode`) that allows you to evaluate code in your Clojure
source files and load it directly in the repl.  A list of all
available commands is available in the nREPL menu and in the following
section of this manual.

## Keys

* **M-x nrepl-jack-in**: Launch an nrepl server and a repl client.
    Prompts for a project root if given a prefix argument.
* **M-x nrepl**: Connect to an already-running nrepl server.

### Clojure buffer commands:

* **C-x C-e**: Evalulate the form preceding point and display the result in the echo area.  If invoked with a prefix argument, insert the result into the current buffer.
* **C-M-x**: Evaluate the top level form under point and display the result in the echo area.  If invoked with a prefix argument, insert the result into the current buffer.
* **C-c C-r**: Evaluate the region and display the result in the echo area.
* **C-c C-b**: Interrupt any pending evaluations.
* **C-c C-m**: Invoke macroexpand-1 on the form preceding point and display result in a macroexpansion buffer. If invoked with a prefix argument, pprint the result.
* **C-c M-m**: Invoke clojure.walk/macroexpand-all on the form preceding point and display result in a macroexpansion buffer. If invoked with a prefix argument, pprint the result.
* **C-c C-n**: Eval the ns form.
* **C-c M-n**: Switch the namespace of the repl buffer to the namespace of the current buffer.
* **C-c C-z**: Select the repl buffer.
* **C-c C-k**: Load the current buffer.
* **C-c C-l**: Load a file.
* **C-c C-d**: Display doc string for the symbol at point.  If invoked with a prefix argument, or no symbol is found at point, prompt for a symbol
* **M-.**: Jump to the definition of a var.  If invoked with a prefix argument, or no symbol is found at point, prompt for a var.
* **M-,**: Return to your pre-jump location.
* **M-TAB**: Complete the symbol at point. (For `auto-complete` integration, see [`ac-nrepl`](https://github.com/purcell/ac-nrepl))

### REPL buffer commands:

* **RET**: Evaluate the current input in Clojure if it is complete. If incomplete, open a new line and indent. If invoked with a prefix argument is given then the input is evaluated without checking for completeness.
* **C-RET**: Close any unmatched parenthesis and then evaluate the current input in Clojure.  Also bound to M-RET.
* **C-j**: Open a new line and indent.
* **C-c M-o**: Clear the entire REPL buffer, leaving only a prompt.
* **C-c C-o**: Remove the output of the previous evaluation from the REPL buffer.
* **C-c C-u**: Kill all text from the prompt to the current point.
* **C-c C-b**: Interrupt any pending evaluations.
* **C-up, C-down**: Goto to previous/next input in history.
* **M-p, M-n**: Search the previous/next item in history using the current input
as search pattern. If M-p/M-n is typed two times in a row, the second invocation
uses the same search pattern (even if the current input has changed).
* **M-s, M-r**: Search forward/reverse through command history with regex.
* **C-c C-n, C-c C-p**: Move between the current and previous prompts in the REPL buffer. Pressing RET on a line with old input copies that line to the newest prompt.

* **TAB**: Complete symbol at point.
