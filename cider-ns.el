;;; Commentary:

;; Smart code refresh functionality based on ideas from:
;; http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded
;;
;; Note that refresh with clojure.tools.namespace.repl is a smarter way to
;; reload code: the traditional way to reload Clojure code without restarting
;; the JVM is (require ... :reload) or an editor/IDE feature that does the same
;; thing.
;;
;; This has several problems:
;;
;; If you modify two namespaces which depend on each other, you must remember to
;; reload them in the correct order to avoid compilation errors.
;;
;; If you remove definitions from a source file and then reload it, those
;; definitions are still available in memory.  If other code depends on those
;; definitions, it will continue to work but will break the next time you
;; restart the JVM.
;;
;; If the reloaded namespace contains defmulti, you must also reload all of the
;; associated defmethod expressions.
;;
;; If the reloaded namespace contains defprotocol, you must also reload any
;; records or types implementing that protocol and replace any existing
;; instances of those records/types with new instances.
;;
;; If the reloaded namespace contains macros, you must also reload any
;; namespaces which use those macros.
;;
;; If the running program contains functions which close over values in the
;; reloaded namespace, those closed-over values are not updated (This is common
;; in web applications which construct the "handler stack" as a composition of
;; functions.)
