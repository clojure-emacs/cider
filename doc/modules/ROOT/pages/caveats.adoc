= Caveats
:experimental:

CIDER is certainly not perfect and has some limitations that everyone
should be aware of.

== ClojureScript limitations

Currently, the following features are not supported for ClojureScript
development:

* Reloading
* Running tests
* Tracing
* Debugging (check out https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1416[this ticket] dedicated to porting the debugger to ClojureScript)
* Enlighten

There is currently no support for both Clojure and ClojureScript evaluation in
the same nREPL session. If Piggieback is active, code evaluation and all
features will assume ClojureScript.

== Microsoft Windows

=== Line separators

On Microsoft Windows the JVM default line separator string is `\r\n`
which can appear in Emacs as `+^M+` characters at the end of lines
printed out by the JVM. One option is to set the
`buffer-display-table` to not show these characters as detailed
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10098925/m-character-showing-in-clojure-slime-repl/11787550#11787550[here]
(changing `slime-repl-mode-hook` to
`cider-repl-mode-hook`). Alternatively, setting the system property
`line.separator` to `\n` at JVM startup will stop the carriage return
from being printed and will fix output in all cider buffers. To do so
add `"-Dline.separator=\"\n\""` to `:jvm-opts` in
`~/.lein/profiles.clj`.

=== Definition lookup in jar files

In order for source lookup commands to work with `.jar` files you'll need to
install either http://www.7-zip.org/[7zip] or `pkunzip` and add its
installation folder to Emacs's `exec-path`. Here's an example:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-to-list 'exec-path "C:/Program Files/7-Zip")
----

== powershell.el

The powershell inferior shell mode truncates CIDER's REPL output when
loaded. As a workaround remove

[source,lisp]
----
(require 'powershell)
----

from your Emacs config.

== ClojureCLR Support

CIDER currently has very basic support ClojureCLR (via either Arcadia's nREPL server or
a port of Babashka's nREPL server). The reasons for this are the following:

* The https://github.com/clojure/clr.tools.nrepl/tree/master/partial-nrepl-nrepl-port[nrepl/nrepl port to ClojureCLR] is not yet working
* `cider-nrepl` uses a lot of Java code internally itself and would need to be adapted/ported like any
  other clojure library adapted/ported to ClojureCLR.

Those issues are not insurmountable, but are beyond the scope of our current roadmap.
If someone would like to tackle them, we'd be happy to provide assistance.

== Injecting dependencies and Leiningen pedantic: abort mode

Because injection currently creates an override of the nREPL dependency that
Leingingen also pulls in starting up the REPL will fail if `:pedantic? :abort`
is set. There are several ways to address this:

* Remove the `:pedantic? :abort` setting.
* Switch off injecting the dependencies with setting `cider-inject-dependencies-at-jack-in` to `nil` and
provide the dependencies by editing your `~/.lein/profiles.clj` as described in
the xref:basics/middleware_setup.adoc#setting-up-a-standalone-repl[standalone REPL] section.
* Adjust the value of `cider-injected-nrepl-version` to the same nREPL version as the
one that's bundled with Leiningen.

== clojure-ts-mode integration

NOTE: `clojure-ts-mode` support was introduced in CIDER 1.14.

CIDER has basic support for working with
https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-ts-mode[clojure-ts-mode] buffers, but it still depends on
https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode[clojure-mode] for certain functionality, like
extracting information about Clojure code out of the buffer. We plan to make `clojure-ts-mode` capable
of providing CIDER with all the functionality it needs to interact with Clojure buffers, but that
will take some time.
