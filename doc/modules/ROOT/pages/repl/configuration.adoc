= REPL Configuration
:experimental:

== Behavior on connect

Normally, when you first establish a REPL connection, the REPL buffer is
auto-displayed in a separate window. You can suppress this behaviour
like this:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-pop-to-buffer-on-connect nil)
----

If you want the REPL buffer to be auto-displayed, but don't want it to be
focused, use this:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-pop-to-buffer-on-connect 'display-only)
----

== Behavior on switch

By default kbd:[C-c C-z] will display the REPL buffer in a
different window.  You can make kbd:[C-c C-z] switch to the CIDER
REPL buffer in the current window:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-display-in-current-window t)
----

== Customizing the REPL prompt

You can customize the REPL buffer prompt by setting
`cider-repl-prompt-function` to a function that takes one
argument, a namespace name. For convenience, CIDER provides three
functions that implement common formats:

* `cider-repl-prompt-lastname`:

----
ssl>
----

* `cider-repl-prompt-abbreviated`:

----
l.c.ssl>
----

* `cider-repl-prompt-default`:

----
leiningen.core.ssl>
----

By default, CIDER uses `cider-repl-prompt-default`.

You may, of course, write your own function. For example, in `leiningen` there
are two namespaces with similar names - `leiningen.classpath` and
`leiningen.core.classpath`. To make them easily recognizable you can either
use the default value or you can opt to show only two segments of the
namespace and still be able to know which is the REPL's current
namespace. Here is an example function that will do exactly that:

[source,lisp]
----
(defun cider-repl-prompt-show-two (namespace)
  "Return a prompt string with the last 2 segments of NAMESPACE."
  (let ((names (reverse (subseq (reverse (split-string namespace "\\.")) 0 2))))
    (concat (car names) "." (cadr names) "> ")))
----

== TAB Completion

You can control the kbd:[TAB] key behavior in the REPL using the
`cider-repl-tab-command` variable.  While the default command
`cider-repl-indent-and-complete-symbol` should be an adequate choice for
most users, it's very easy to switch to another command if you wish
to. For instance if you'd like kbd:[TAB] to only indent (maybe
because you're used to completing with kbd:[M-TAB]) use the
following:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-tab-command #'indent-for-tab-command)
----

== Auto-scrolling the REPL on Output

Prior to version 0.21.0, the REPL buffer would be automatically re-centered
whenever any output was printed, so that the prompt was on the bottom line of
the window, displaying the maximum possible amount of output above it. This is
no longer the default behaviour -- you can now replicate it by setting the
built-in option `scroll-conservatively`, for example:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook '(lambda () (setq scroll-conservatively 101)))
----

== Result Prefix

You can change the string used to prefix REPL results:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-result-prefix ";; => ")
----

Which then results in the following REPL output:

----
user> (+ 1 2)
;; => 3
----

By default, REPL results have no prefix.

== Customize the REPL Buffer's Name

You can customize the buffer name using the variable
`cider-session-name-template`. See the documentation for this variable for
details.


== Font-locking

Normally, code in the REPL is font-locked the same way as in
`clojure-mode`. Before CIDER 0.10, by default, REPL input was
font-locked with `cider-repl-input-face` (after pressing
kbd:[Return]) and results were font-locked with
`cider-repl-result-face`. If you want to restore the old behaviour
use:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-use-clojure-font-lock nil)
----

Note that enabling font-locking in the REPL can negatively impact performance.

== Pretty printing in the REPL

By default the REPL always prints the results of your evaluations using the
printing function specified by `cider-print-fn`.

!!! Note

 This behaviour was changed in CIDER 0.20. In prior CIDER releases
 pretty-printing was disabled by default.

You can temporarily disable this behaviour and revert to the default behaviour
(equivalent to `clojure.core/pr`) using kbd:[M-x cider-repl-toggle-pretty-printing].

If you want to disable using `cider-print-fn` entirely, use:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-use-pretty-printing nil)
----

Note that disabling pretty-printing is not advised. Emacs does not handle well
very long lines, so using a printing function that wraps lines beyond a certain
width (i.e. any of them except for `pr`) will keep your REPL running smoothly.

See link:../pretty_printing[this] for more information on configuring printing.

== Displaying images in the REPL

Starting with CIDER 0.17 (Andaluc√≠a) expressions that evaluate to
images will be rendered as images in the REPL. You can disable this
behavior if you don't like it.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-use-content-types nil)
----

Alternatively, you can toggle this behaviour on and off using kbd:[M-x cider-repl-toggle-content-types].

== Customizing the initial REPL namespace

Normally, the CIDER REPL will start in the `user` namespace.  You can
supply an initial namespace for REPL sessions in the `repl-options`
section of your Leiningen project configuration:

[source,clojure]
----
:repl-options {:init-ns 'my-ns}
----

== Customizing newline interaction

Ordinarily, kbd:[Return] immediate sends a form for
evaluation. If you want to insert a newline into the REPL buffer as
you're editing, you can do so using kbd:[C-j]. If you are
entering a lot of longer forms that span multiple lines, it may be
more convenient to change the keybindings:

[source,lisp]
----
(define-key cider-repl-mode-map (kbd "RET") #'cider-repl-newline-and-indent)
(define-key cider-repl-mode-map (kbd "C-<return>") #'cider-repl-return)
----

This will make kbd:[Return] insert a newline into the REPL buffer
and kbd:[C-Return] send the form off for evaluation.

== REPL history

* To make the REPL history wrap around when CIDER reaches the end:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-wrap-history t)
----

* To adjust the maximum number of items kept in the REPL history:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-history-size 1000) ; the default is 500
----

* To store the REPL history in a file:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-history-file "path/to/file")
----

Note that CIDER writes the history to the file when you kill the REPL
buffer, which includes invoking `cider-quit`, or when you quit Emacs.

== Set ns in REPL

By default `cider-repl-set-ns` won't require the target ns, just set
it. That's done with the assumption that you've probably evaluated the
ns in question already before switching to it (e.g. by doing `C-c C-k`
in its source file). If you want to change this behaviour (to avoid
calling `cider-repl-set-ns` and then `(require 'my-ns)` manually), you
can set:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-repl-require-ns-on-set t)
----

== Control what window to use when jumping to a definition

By default kbd:[M-.] and other commands that jump to a definition use the current
window to show the definition.

Other behaviour is possible, and is controlled with
`cider-jump-to-pop-to-buffer-actions`; the value of this is passed as the
`action` argument to `pop-to-buffer`.

The default value is `\((display-buffer-same-window))`; this means to always use
the current window.

An alternative is to use an existing window in the current frame when there is
one that is showing the target buffer. If you want this behaviour, set:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-jump-to-pop-to-buffer-actions
      '((display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-same-window)))
----

For other possibilities, see the documentation for `display-buffer`.

=== Example 1

You jump to `map` in core.clj when core.clj *_is not_* being displayed in another
window in the current frame.

With both the default behaviour and the alternative behaviour defined above, the
definition of `map` will be shown in the current window.

=== Example 2

You jump to `map` in core.clj when core.clj *_is_* being displayed in another window
in the current frame.

With the default behaviour, the definition of `map` will be shown in the current
window; you will now have two windows showing core.clj, and the existing
core.clj window will be unchanged.

With the alternative behaviour defined above, the definition of `map` will be
shown in the existing core.clj window; all windows will show the same buffer as
before the jump, and the current window will now be the one showing core.clj.
