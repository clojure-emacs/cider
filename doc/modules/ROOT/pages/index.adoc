CIDER is the **C**lojure(Script) **I**nteractive **D**evelopment **E**nvironment
that **R**ocks!

CIDER extends Emacs with support for interactive programming in Clojure. The
features are centered around `cider-mode`, an Emacs minor-mode that complements
https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode[clojure-mode]. While `clojure-mode` supports editing Clojure source files,
`cider-mode` adds support for interacting with a running Clojure process for
compilation, debugging, definition and documentation lookup, running tests and
so on.

.Inspired by SLIME
****
CIDER was originally inspired by the powerful Common Lisp interactive
development environment https://github.com/slime/slime[SLIME]. In the beginning we started by
adapting SLIME's core functionality to Clojure, but over the course of time
CIDER became pretty different from SLIME in many areas. Check out

== Overview

CIDER aims to provide an interactive development experience similar to the one
you'd get when programming in Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp (with https://github.com/slime/slime[SLIME] or https://github.com/capitaomorte/sly[Sly]),
Scheme (with https://github.com/jaor/geiser[Geiser]) and Smalltalk.

Programmers are expected to program in a very dynamic and incremental manner,
constantly re-evaluating existing Clojure definitions and adding new ones to
their running applications. You never stop/start a Clojure application while
using CIDER - you're constantly interacting with it and changing it.

You can find more details about the typical CIDER workflow in the
xref:usage/interactive_programming.adoc[Interactive Programming] section. While we're a bit
short on video tutorials, you can check out this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYA4AAjLfT0[introduction to CIDER] to get a
feel about what do we mean by an "Interactive Development Environment".

CIDER's built on top of https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl[nREPL], the Clojure networked REPL server.

CIDER's basic architecture looks something like this:

Clojure code gets executed by an nREPL server. CIDER sends requests to the
server and processes its responses. The server's functionality is augmented by
additional https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl[nREPL middleware], designed specifically to address the needs of an
interactive development environment like CIDER.

.An Editor-agnostic Foundation
****
Much of the nREPL middleware we originally developed for CIDER is
editor-agnostic and is being used by other Clojure development
environments as well
(e.g. https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace[vim-fireplace] &
https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva[Calva]).

== Features

CIDER packs plenty of features. Here are some of them (in no particular order):

* Interactive code evaluation
* Powerful REPL
* Code completion
* Code reloading
* Definition & documentation lookup
* Enhanced error reporting
* `clojure.test` integration
* `clojure.spec` integration
* Interactive debugger
* ClojureScript support

And many many more... The rest of this manual will be exploring CIDER's features in great detail.

== CIDER in Action

Below you can see a typical CIDER session.

Here the user checked the documentation for `clojure.core/merge` straight from the source buffer
and then jumped to a REPL buffer to try out something there.
