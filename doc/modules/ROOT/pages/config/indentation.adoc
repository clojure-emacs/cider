= Indentation

CIDER relies on `clojure-mode` to do the indentation of Clojure code. While `clojure-mode`
will generally indent code "the right way", from time to time you might want to teach it
how to indent certain macros.

There are two ways to do this - you can either add some indentation configuration in your Emacs config
or you can add it to your Clojure code and let CIDER generate the necessary configuration for
`clojure-mode` automatically. We'll refer to the first approach as "static indentation" and to the second
one as "dynamic indentation".

== Static Indentation

NOTE: Everything is this section will work as described even if CIDER is not present/active. Static indentation
doesn't require a REPL to work.

`clojure-mode` is smart enough to indent most Clojure code correctly out-of-the-box, but it can't know
if something is a macro and its body should be indented differently.

`clojure-mode` is very flexible when it comes to indentation configuration and here we are going to go over the basics.

=== Indentation Modes

There are few common ways to indent Clojure code and all of them are supported by `clojure-mode`.

The indentation of function forms is configured by the variable
`clojure-indent-style`. It takes three possible values:

- `always-align` (the default)

[source,clojure]
----
(some-function
 10
 1
 2)
(some-function 10
               1
               2)
----

- `always-indent`

[source,clojure]
----
(some-function
  10
  1
  2)
(some-function 10
  1
  2)
----

- `align-arguments`

[source,clojure]
----
(some-function
  10
  1
  2)
(some-function 10
               1
               2)
----

TIP: You can read more about the indentation options in `clojure-mode` https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode#indentation-options[here].

=== Macro Indentation

As mentioned earlier, `clojure-mode` can't know if something in your code is a macro that has to be indented
differently from a regular function invocation (most likely because the macro takes some forms as parameters).
In such situation you need to
teach `clojure-mode` how to indent the macro in question. Consider this simple example:

[source,clojure]
----
(defmacro with-in-str
  "[DOCSTRING]"
  {:style/indent 1}
  [s & body]
  ...cut for brevity...)

;; Target indentation
(with-in-str str
  (foo)
  (bar)
  (baz))
----

To get `clojure-mode` to indent it properly you'll need to add the following code to your Emacs config:

[source,lisp]
----
(put-clojure-indent 'with-in-str 1)

;; or

(define-clojure-indent
  (with-in-str 1)
----

TIP: You can find more details https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode#indentation-of-macro-forms[here].

== Dynamic Indentation

It is common for macros to require special indentation mechanisms. This is most
common in macros that start with `do`, `def`, or `with-`.  CIDER has some
heuristics to detect these macros, but it also lets you explicitly specify how
a macro should be indented.

Here's a simple example of how someone would specify the indent spec for a macro
they've written (using an example in core):

[source,clojure]
----
(defmacro with-in-str
  "[DOCSTRING]"
  {:style/indent 1}
  [s & body]
  ...cut for brevity...)

;; Target indentation
(with-in-str str
  (foo)
  (bar)
  (baz))
----

And here's a more complex one:

[source,clojure]
----
(defmacro letfn
  "[DOCSTRING]"
  {:style/indent [1 [[:defn]] :form]}
  [fnspecs & body]
  ...cut for brevity...)

;; Target indentation
(letfn [(six-times [y]
           (* (twice y) 3))
        (twice [x]
           (* x 2))]
  (println "Twice 15 =" (twice 15))
  (println "Six times 15 =" (six-times 15)))
----

Don't worry if this looks intimidating. For most macros the indent spec should
be either just a number, or one of the keywords `:defn` or `:form`. A full
description of the spec is provided in the
xref:indent_spec.adoc[indent spec section of the manual].

If you _don't_ want to use this feature, you can disable it by setting
`cider-dynamic-indentation` to `nil` in your Emacs init file.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-dynamic-indentation nil)
