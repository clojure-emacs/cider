= Syntax highlighting

== Dynamic syntax highlighting

CIDER can syntax highlight symbols that are known to be defined. By default,
this is done on symbols from the `clojure.core` namespace, as well as macros
from any namespace. If you'd like CIDER to also colorize usages of functions
and variables from any namespace, do:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-font-lock-dynamically '(macro core function var))
----

Here's how code looks without dynamic syntax highlighting.

And here's how the code looks when it's turned on.

== Syntax highlighting for reader conditionals

By default CIDER will apply font-locking to unused reader conditional
expressions depending on the buffer's CIDER connection type.

You can disable this behavior by adjusting `cider-font-lock-reader-conditionals`:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-font-lock-reader-conditionals nil)
----

== Customizing CIDER faces

CIDER defines a few custom faces that you might want to adjust (although normally your color theme
should take care of them):

* `cider-deprecated-face` - used for syntax highlighting deprecated vars
* `cider-instrumented-face` - used for syntax highlighting instrumented for debugging vars
* `cider-traced-face` - used for syntax highlighting traced vars
* `cider-reader-conditional-face` - used for syntax highlighting inactive reader conditional branches
