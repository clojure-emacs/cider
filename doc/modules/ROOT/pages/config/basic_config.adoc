= Basic Configuration
:experimental:

Like Emacs itself, almost every part of CIDER is configurable. The
CIDER developers have tried to implement some reasonable defaults that
should work for a large portion of the Clojure community, but we know
that there is nothing approaching a "one size fits all" development
environment and we've tried to create points of customization that can
account for many different peoples' preferences. In this way, you
should be able to make CIDER as comfortable as possible for *you*.

This section doesn't describe every possible customization that CIDER
offers, but here are some of the most popular.

TIP: You can see every single customizable configuration option with the command
kbd:[M-x customize-group RET cider].

== Disable Automatic cider-mode in clojure-mode Buffers

By default, CIDER enables `cider-mode` in all `clojure-mode` buffers
after it establishes the first CIDER connection. It will also add a
`clojure-mode` hook to enable `cider-mode` on newly-created `clojure-mode`
buffers. You can override this behavior, however:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-auto-mode nil)
----

== Prompt for Symbol Confirmation

NOTE: The default here was changed in CIDER 1.0.

By default, CIDER won't prompt you for a symbol when it executes
interactive commands that require a symbol (e.g. `cider-doc`). Such
commands operate on the symbol at point and prompt you to provide
a symbol if they can't obtain one automatically.

If you set
`cider-prompt-for-symbol` to `t`, this behavior will be inverted and
CIDER will always prompt you to confirm the symbol on which a command
will operate. This behavior is useful, as it allows you to edit the
inferred symbol, before some operation is carried out with it (and you get to
see what was inferred by `cider-symbol-at-point`).

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-prompt-for-symbol t)
----

TIP: Many interactive commands that operate on the symbol at point,
accept a prefix argument that flips the behavior configured via
`cider-prompt-for-symbol` for the current command invocation.

== Control what window to use when jumping to a definition

By default kbd:[M-.] and other commands that jump to a definition have the following behavior:

* If the definition buffer is visible simply switch to it.
* Otherwise, use the current window to show the definition.

Other behavior is possible, and is controlled with
`cider-jump-to-pop-to-buffer-actions`; the value of this is passed as the
`action` argument to `pop-to-buffer`.

The default value is `\((display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-same-window))`.

Some people might prefer to always display the definition in the current
window. Here's how you can achieve this:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-jump-to-pop-to-buffer-actions
      '((display-buffer-same-window)))
----

WARNING: Keep in mind this might cause problems with some special buffers (e.g. test report buffers),
as when you try to navigate to a definition this will clobber the special buffer.

For other possibilities, see the documentation for `display-buffer`.

=== Example 1

You jump to `map` in `core.clj` when `core.clj` *_is not_* being displayed in another
window in the current frame.

With both the default behavior and the alternative behavior defined above, the
definition of `map` will be shown in the current window.

=== Example 2

You jump to `map` in `core.clj` when `core.clj` *_is_* being displayed in another window
in the current frame.

With the default behavior, the definition of `map` will be shown in the current
window; you will now have two windows showing `core.clj`, and the existing
`core.clj` window will be unchanged.

With the alternative behavior defined above, the definition of `map` will be
shown in the existing `core.clj` window; all windows will show the same buffer as
before the jump, and the current window will now be the one showing `core.clj`.

== Minibuffer completion

Out-of-the box, CIDER uses the standard `completing-read` Emacs mechanism. While
it's not fancy it certainly gets the job done (just press kbd:[TAB]). There
are, however, ways to improve upon the standard completion if you wish to.

=== icomplete

`icomplete` is bundled with Emacs and enhances the default minibuffer completion:

[source,lisp]
----
(require 'icomplete)
----

You can learn more about `icomplete`
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Icomplete.html[here].

=== ido

`ido` is also bundled with Emacs and offers more features than `icomplete`.
If you are using `ido`, be sure to use both `ido-everywhere`
and https://github.com/DarwinAwardWinner/ido-completing-read-plus[`ido-completing-read+`].
You might also want to install https://github.com/lewang/flx[`ido-flex`].

=== ivy (recommended)

If you're fine with installing a third-party package for enhanced minibuffer
completion you can't go wrong with the modern and versatile
http://oremacs.com/2015/04/16/ivy-mode/[ivy].

== Log nREPL Communications

If you want to see all communications between CIDER and the nREPL
server:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq nrepl-log-messages t)
----

CIDER will then create buffers named `+*nrepl-messages conn-name*+` for
each connection.

The communication log is tremendously valuable for
debugging CIDER-to-nREPL problems and we recommend you enable it when
you are facing such issues.

== Hide Special nREPL Buffers

If you're finding that `+*nrepl-connection*+` and `+*nrepl-server*+`
buffers are cluttering up your development environment, you can
suppress them from appearing in some buffer switching commands like
`switch-to-buffer`(kbd:[C-x b]):

[source,lisp]
----
(setq nrepl-hide-special-buffers t)
----

If you need to make the hidden buffers appear When using
`switch-to-buffer`, type kbd:[SPC] after issuing the command. The
hidden buffers will always be visible in `list-buffers` (kbd:[C-x C-b]).

== Prefer Local Resources Over Remote Resources

To prefer local resources to remote resources (tramp) when both are available:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-prefer-local-resources t)
----

== Translate File Paths

If you wish to translate file paths from your running instance you may use the
`cider-path-translations` defcustom to do so. For instance, suppose your app is
running in a docker container with your source directories mounted there. The
navigation paths you'd get from nREPL will be relative to the source in the
docker container rather than the correct path on your host machine. You can add
translation mappings easily by setting the following (typically in `.dir-locals.el`):

[source,lisp]
----
((nil
  (cider-path-translations . (("/root/.m2" . "/Users/foo/.m2")
                              ("/src/" . "/Users/foo/projects")))))
----

Each entry will be interpreted as a directory entry so trailing slash
is optional. Navigation to definition will attempt to translate these locations, and
if they exist, navigate there rather than report that the file does not
exist. In the example above, the `.m2` directory is mounted at `/root/.m2`
and the source at `/src`. These translations would map these locations
back to the user's computer so that navigation to definition would work.

Using the `eval` pseudo-variable you can make the translation dynamic, enabling
the possibility of sharing the `.dir-locals.el` across a team of developers with
different configurations.

[source,lisp]
----
((nil . ((eval . (customize-set-variable 'cider-path-translations
                                         (list
                                           (cons "/src" (clojure-project-dir))
                                           (cons "/root/.m2" (concat (getenv "HOME") "/.m2"))))))))
----

In this example, the path `/src` will be translated to the correct path of your
Clojure project on the host machine. And `/root/.m2` to the host's `~/.m2` folder.

== Use a Local Copy of the JDK API Documentation

If you are targeting the JVM and prefer a local copy of the JDK API
documentation over Oracle's official copy (e.g., for
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/[JavaSE 8]), per nREPL's
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/[`javadoc-info` logic (accurate as of 29 Dec 2014)],
you can arrange your project to include the *root* path of the local API doc
(i.e., where the `index.html` is located) to be included on your classpath
(i.e., where the doc HTML files can be located by
`clojure.java.io/resource`). For example, for Leiningen, with the local API
path being `/usr/share/doc/java/api/`, put the following line in
`project.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
:dev {:resource-paths ["/usr/share/doc/java/api/"]}
----

*or* the following line in `$HOME/.lein/profiles.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
:user {:resource-paths ["/usr/share/doc/java/api/"]}
----

More details can be found https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/930[here].

== Use a Local Copy of the Java Source Code

When an exception is thrown, e.g. when eval-ing `(. clojure.lang.RT foo)`, a
stack trace pops up. Some places of the stack trace link to Clojure files,
others to Java files. By default, you can click the Clojure file links to
navigate there. If you configure `cider-jdk-src-paths`, you can also click the
Java file links to navigate there.

On Windows and macOS the JDK source code is bundled with the JDK. On Windows its
typical location is `+C:\Program Files\Java\{jdk-version}\src.zip+`
and on macOS it's `+/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/{jdk-version}/Contents/Home/src.zip+`.

On Linux distributions usually the source code is distributed as a separate package.
Here's how do get the JDK 8 source on Ubuntu:

 sudo apt install openjdk-8-source

The zip is installed to `/usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-8/src.zip`.

You can download Clojure Java source code from
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/clojure/clojure/1.8.0/clojure-1.8.0-sources.jar[here].

Extract both and configure e.g. like so:

 (setq cider-jdk-src-paths '("~/java/clojure-1.8.0-sources"
                             "~/java/openjvm-8-src"))

It's possible to point `cider-jdk-src-paths` to `jar` or `zip` files, but extracting
them is better since you can use features like `ag` or `dired-jump`.

== Filter out namespaces in certain namespace-related commands

You can hide all nREPL middleware details from `cider-browse-ns*` and `cider-apropos*`
commands by customizing the variable `cider-filter-regexps`. The value of this
variable should be a list of regexps matching the pattern of namespaces you want
to filter out.

Its default value is `+'("^cider.nrepl" "^refactor-nrepl" "^nrepl")+`,
the most commonly used middleware collections/packages.

An important thing to note is that this list of regexps is passed on to the middleware
without any pre-processing. So, the regexps have to be in Clojure format (with twice the number of backslashes)
and not Emacs Lisp. For example, to achieve the above effect, you could also set `cider-filter-regexps` to `'(".*nrepl")`.

To customize `cider-filter-regexps`, you could use the Emacs customize UI,
with kbd:[M-x] `customize-variable` kbd:[RET] `cider-filter-regexps`.

An alternative is to set the variable along with the other CIDER configuration.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-filter-regexps '(".*nrepl"))
----

== Truncate long lines in special buffers

By default contents of CIDER's special buffers such as `+*cider-test-report*+`
or `+*cider-doc*+` are line truncated. You can set
`cider-special-mode-truncate-lines` to `nil` to make those buffers use word
wrapping instead of line truncating.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-special-mode-truncate-lines nil)
----

IMPORTANT: This variable should be set *before* loading CIDER (which means before
`require`-ing it or autoloading it).
