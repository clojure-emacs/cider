= Basic Configuration
:experimental:

Like Emacs itself, almost every part of CIDER is configurable. The
CIDER developers have tried to implement some reasonable defaults that
should work for a large portion of the Clojure community, but we know
that there is nothing approaching a "one size fits all" development
environment and we've tried to create points of customization that can
account for many different peoples' preferences. In this way, you
should be able to make CIDER as comfortable as possible for *you*.

You can see every single customizable configuration option with the command
kbd:[M-x customize-group RET cider].

This section doesn't describe every possible customization that CIDER
offers, but here are some of the most popular.

== Disable Automatic cider-mode in clojure-mode Buffers

By default, CIDER enables `cider-mode` in all `clojure-mode` buffers
after it establishes the first CIDER connection. It will also add a
`clojure-mode` hook to enable `cider-mode` on newly-created `clojure-mode`
buffers. You can override this behavior, however:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-auto-mode nil)
----

== Disable Symbol Confirmation

By default, CIDER prompts you for a symbol when it executes
interactive commands that require a symbol (e.g. `cider-doc`). The
default symbol will be the one at point. If you set
`cider-prompt-for-symbol` to `nil`, CIDER will try the symbol at point
first, and only prompt if that fails (this was the behavior in older
CIDER releases).

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-prompt-for-symbol nil)
----

== Log nREPL Communications

If you want to see all communications between CIDER and the nREPL
server:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq nrepl-log-messages t)
----

CIDER will then create buffers named `+*nrepl-messages conn-name*+` for
each connection.

The communication log is tremendously valuable for
debugging CIDER-to-nREPL problems and we recommend you enable it when
you are facing such issues.

== Hide Special nREPL Buffers

If you're finding that `+*nrepl-connection*+` and `+*nrepl-server*+`
buffers are cluttering up your development environment, you can
suppress them from appearing in some buffer switching commands like
`switch-to-buffer`(kbd:[C-x b]):

[source,lisp]
----
(setq nrepl-hide-special-buffers t)
----

If you need to make the hidden buffers appear When using
`switch-to-buffer`, type kbd:[SPC] after issuing the command. The
hidden buffers will always be visible in `list-buffers` (kbd:[C-x C-b]).

== Prefer Local Resources Over Remote Resources

To prefer local resources to remote resources (tramp) when both are available:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-prefer-local-resources t)
----

== Translate File Paths

If you wish to translate file paths from your running instance you may use the
`cider-path-translations` defcustom to do so. For instance, suppose your app is
running in a docker container with your source directories mounted there. The
navigation paths you'd get from nREPL will be relative to the source in the
docker container rather than the correct path on your host machine. You can add
translation mappings easily by setting the following (typically in `.dir-locals.el`):

[source,lisp]
----
((nil
  (cider-path-translations . (("/root" . "/Users/foo")
                              ("/src/" . "/Users/foo/projects")))))
----

Each entry will be interpreted as a directory entry so trailing slash
is optional. Navigation to definition will attempt to translate these locations, and
if they exist, navigate there rather than report that the file does not
exist. In the example above, the `.m2` directory is mounted at `/root/.m2`
and the source at `/src`. These translations would map these locations
back to the user's computer so that navigation to definition would work.

== Auto-Save Clojure Buffers on Load

Normally, CIDER prompts you to save a modified Clojure buffer when you
type kbd:[C-c C-k] (`cider-load-buffer`).  You can change this
behaviour by adjusting `cider-save-file-on-load`.

Don't prompt and don't save:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-save-file-on-load nil)
----

Just save without prompting:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-save-file-on-load t)
----

== Change the Result Prefix for Interactive Evaluation

Change the result prefix for interactive evaluation (not the REPL
prefix). By default the prefix is `=> `.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-eval-result-prefix ";; => ")
----

To remove the prefix altogether, just set it to the empty string (`""`).

== Use a Local Copy of the JDK API Documentation

If you are targeting the JVM and prefer a local copy of the JDK API
documentation over Oracle's official copy (e.g., for
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/[JavaSE 8]), per nREPL's
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/[`javadoc-info` logic (accurate as of 29 Dec 2014)],
you can arrange your project to include the *root* path of the local API doc
(i.e., where the `index.html` is located) to be included on your classpath
(i.e., where the doc HTML files can be located by
`clojure.java.io/resource`). For example, for Leiningen, with the local API
path being `/usr/share/doc/java/api/`, put the following line in
`project.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
:dev {:resource-paths ["/usr/share/doc/java/api/"]}
----

*or* the following line in `$HOME/.lein/profiles.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
:user {:resource-paths ["/usr/share/doc/java/api/"]}
----

More details can be found https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/930[here].

== Use a Local Copy of the Java Source Code

When an exception is thrown, e.g. when eval-ing `(. clojure.lang.RT foo)`, a
stack trace pops up. Some places of the stack trace link to Clojure files,
others to Java files. By default, you can click the Clojure file links to
navigate there. If you configure `cider-jdk-src-paths`, you can also click the
Java file links to navigate there.

On Windows and macOS the JDK source code is bundled with the JDK. On Windows its
typical location is `+C:\Program Files\Java\{jdk-version}\src.zip+`
and on macOS it's `+/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/{jdk-version}/Contents/Home/src.zip+`.

On Linux distributions usually the source code is distributed as a separate package.
Here's how do get the JDK 8 source on Ubuntu:

 sudo apt install openjdk-8-source

The zip is installed to `/usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-8/src.zip`.

You can download Clojure Java source code from
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/clojure/clojure/1.8.0/clojure-1.8.0-sources.jar[here].

Extract both and configure e.g. like so:

 (setq cider-jdk-src-paths '("~/java/clojure-1.8.0-sources"
                             "~/java/openjvm-8-src"))

It's possible to point `cider-jdk-src-paths` to `jar` or `zip` files, but extracting
them is better since you can use features like `ag` or `dired-jump`.

== Filter out namespaces in certain namespace-related commands

You can hide all nREPL middleware details from `cider-browse-ns*` and `cider-apropos*`
commands by customizing the variable `cider-filter-regexps`. The value of this
variable should be a list of regexps matching the pattern of namespaces you want
to filter out.

Its default value is `+'("^cider.nrepl" "^refactor-nrepl" "^nrepl")+`,
the most commonly used middleware collections/packages.

An important thing to note is that this list of regexps is passed on to the middleware
without any pre-processing. So, the regexps have to be in Clojure format (with twice the number of backslashes)
and not Emacs Lisp. For example, to achieve the above effect, you could also set `cider-filter-regexps` to `'(".*nrepl")`.

To customize `cider-filter-regexps`, you could use the Emacs customize UI,
with kbd:[M-x] `customize-variable` kbd:[RET] `cider-filter-regexps`.

An alternative is to set the variable along with the other CIDER configuration.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-filter-regexps '(".*nrepl"))
----

== Truncate long lines in special buffers

By default contents of CIDER's special buffers such as `+*cider-test-report*+`
or `+*cider-doc*+` are line truncated. You can set
`cider-special-mode-truncate-lines` to `nil` to make those buffers use word
wrapping instead of line truncating.

*This variable should be set before loading CIDER* (which means before
`require`-ing it or autoloading it).

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-special-mode-truncate-lines nil)
----
