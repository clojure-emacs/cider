= Macroexpansion
:experimental:

Typing kbd:[C-c C-m] after some form in a source buffer or the
REPL will show you the macro expansion of the form in a new
buffer. You'll have access to additional keybindings in the macro
expansion buffer (which is internally using
`cider-macroexpansion-mode`):

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[m]
| Invoke `macroexpand-1` on the form at point and replace the original form with its expansion.  If invoked with a prefix argument, `macroexpand` is used instead of `macroexpand-1`.

| kbd:[a]
| Invoke `clojure.walk/macroexpand-all` on the form at point and replace the original form with its expansion.

| kbd:[g]
| The prior macro expansion is performed again and the current contents of the macro expansion buffer are replaced with the new expansion.

| kbd:[C-/] +
kbd:[u]
| Undo the last in-place expansion performed in the macroexpansion buffer.
