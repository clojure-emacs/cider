== Expanding Macros

Typing kbd:[C-c C-m] after some form in a source buffer or the
REPL will show you the macro expansion of the form in a new
buffer. You'll have access to additional keybindings in the macro
expansion buffer (which is internally using
`cider-macroexpansion-mode`):

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[m]
| Invoke `macroexpand-1` on the form at point and replace the original form with its expansion.  If invoked with a prefix argument, `macroexpand` is used instead of `macroexpand-1`.

| kbd:[a]
| Invoke `clojure.walk/macroexpand-all` on the form at point and replace the original form with its expansion.

| kbd:[g]
| The prior macro expansion is performed again and the current contents of the macro expansion buffer are replaced with the new expansion.

| kbd:[C-/] +
kbd:[u]
| Undo the last in-place expansion performed in the macroexpansion buffer.

== Inspecting Values

Typing kbd:[C-c M-i] after some form in a source buffer or the
REPL will show you the structure for the result of the form in a new
buffer.  You can also use kbd:[C-u C-c M-i] to inspect the result
of the current top-level form and kbd:[C-u C-u C-c M-i] to read
an expression from the minibuffer and inspect its result. You'll have
access to additional keybindings in the inspector buffer (which is
internally using `cider-inspector-mode`):

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[Tab] or kbd:[Shift-Tab]
| Navigate inspectable sub-objects

| kbd:[Return]
| Inspect sub-objects

| kbd:[l]
| Pop to the parent object

| kbd:[g]
| Refresh the inspector (e.g. if viewing an atom/ref/agent)

| kbd:[SPC]
| Jump to next page in paginated view

| kbd:[M-SPC]
| Jump to previous page in paginated view

| kbd:[s]
| Set a new page size in paginated view

| kbd:[d]
| Defines a var with current inspector value
