= Tracing Function Execution
:experimental:

You can trace the arguments supplied, to and the result values produced
by functions using kbd:[C-c M-t v]. CIDER will prompt you for the
name of the function you want to trace, defaulting to the previous
top-level definition.

Invoking kbd:[C-c M-t v] again for the same function will result
in the function being untraced.

You can also use kbd:[C-c M-t n] to toggle tracing on and off for
an entire namespace.
