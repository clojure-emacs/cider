= Inspector
:experimental:

Typing kbd:[C-c M-i] (`cider-inspect`) after some form in a source
buffer or the REPL will show you the structure for the result of the
form in a new buffer. You can also use kbd:[C-u C-c M-i] to inspect
the result of the current top-level form and kbd:[C-u C-u C-c M-i] to
read an expression from the minibuffer and inspect its result.

Alternatively, after a regular eval command, you can inspect the last
evaluated value using `cider-inspect-last-result`. When a inspector
buffer is visible in the background, it is automatically updated with
the last result. This behavior can be controlled with the variable
`cider-auto-inspect-after-eval`.

The inspector can also be invoked in the middle of a debugging
session, see xref:debugger.adoc[here] for more details.

You'll have access to additional keybindings in the inspector buffer
(which is internally using `cider-inspector-mode`):

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[Tab] and kbd:[Shift-Tab]
| Navigate inspectable sub-objects

| kbd:[Return]
| Inspect sub-objects

| kbd:[l]
| Pop to the parent object

| kbd:[g]
| Refresh the inspector (e.g. if viewing an atom/ref/agent)

| kbd:[SPC]
| Jump to next page in paginated view

| kbd:[M-SPC]
| Jump to previous page in paginated view

| kbd:[s]
| Set a new page size in paginated view

| kbd:[d]
| Defines a var in the REPL namespace with current inspector value
|===


By default, navigation skips over values like nils, numbers and
keywords, which are not interesting to inspect. You can control this
behavior using the variable `cider-inspector-skip-uninteresting`.
