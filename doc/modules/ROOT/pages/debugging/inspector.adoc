= Inspector
:experimental:

Typing kbd:[C-c M-i] after some form in a source buffer or the
REPL will show you the structure for the result of the form in a new
buffer.  You can also use kbd:[C-u C-c M-i] to inspect the result
of the current top-level form and kbd:[C-u C-u C-c M-i] to read
an expression from the minibuffer and inspect its result. You'll have
access to additional keybindings in the inspector buffer (which is
internally using `cider-inspector-mode`):
