= Dealing with Errors
:experimental:

Every now and then you'll make some mistake in your code which is
going to result in an evaluation error. Clojure's errors are
notorious for their complexity and CIDER takes a lot of effort
to make it easier to decipher those.

Most of the time CIDER will display the errors in a dedicated buffer
alongside the buffer you're currently evaluating code in.

TIP: Use kbd:[q] to quickly close an error buffer.

== Configuration

By default, when an exception occurs, CIDER will display the exception
in an error buffer using `cider-stacktrace-mode`. You can suppress
this behavior, which causes just the error message to be output as a
temporary overlay or in the echo area:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-show-error-buffer nil)
----

At times, the error being displayed will originate from a bug in CIDER
itself. These internal errors might frequently occur and interrupt
your workflow, but you might not want to suppress *all* stacktrace
buffers by using `cider-show-error-buffer`. Instead, you might only
want to suppress _this specific type_ of internal error. The
stacktrace buffers provide such an option when displaying an internal
error. A toggle button will be displayed with the error type's name,
and you can toggle whether this particular type of error will cause
the stacktrace buffer to automatically show itself.  The toggle button
controls this behavior only during the current Emacs session, but if
you would like to make the suppression more permanent, you can do so
by customizing the `cider-stacktrace-suppressed-errors` variable.  The
buffer will also provide a direct link to the bug reporting page to
help facilitate its diagnosis and repair.

Independently of the value of `cider-show-error-buffer` or
`cider-stacktrace-suppressed-errors`, CIDER always generates the error
buffer in the background. You can use `cider-selector` (kbd:[C-c M-s]) to
visit this buffer if you decide that you need to.

There are two more selective strategies for the error buffer:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-show-error-buffer 'except-in-repl) ; or
(setq cider-show-error-buffer 'only-in-repl)
----

To disable auto-selection of the error buffer when it's displayed:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-auto-select-error-buffer nil)
----

== Navigating Stacktraces

CIDER comes with a powerful solution for dealing with Clojure
stacktraces. CIDER presents stack traces in a special major mode,
`cider-stacktrace-mode`, which gives you gives you some key features:

* the ability to filter out certain stack frames to reduce clutter
* some handy ways to navigate to the cause of the exception
* the ability to jump straight to code with a single keystroke

|===

=== Filtering Stack Frames

CIDER helps you cut through the clutter of Clojure stacktraces by
allowing you to apply a list of filters using the
`cider-stacktrace-default-filters` variable. Valid filter types
include `java`, `clj`, `repl`, `tooling`, and `dup`. Specifying one of
these filters will remove the corresponding frames from the stacktrace
display. There are also "positive" filtering types (reverse filters)
that specify what should be shown. The value of `project`, for
instance, will cause only project frames to be shown, and `all` will
force all stackframes to be shown. Note that `project` and `all` are
mutually exclusive. Whichever one is first will determine the behavior
if they are both present.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-stacktrace-default-filters '(tooling dup))
;; or
(setq cider-stacktrace-default-filters '(project))
----

=== Wrapping Error Messages

Finally, CIDER can wrap error messages when they are displayed in a
buffer to help improve their readability. CIDER uses
`cider-stacktrace-fill-column` for this, which can take on three
types of values:

* `nil`: The error is not wrapped.
* numeric: The error message is wrapped to the specified fill column.
* Something truthy but non-numeric: The error message is wrapped using
the value of `fill-column`.

The following will cause error messages to be wrapped to 80 columns,
for instance:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-stacktrace-fill-column 80)
----

=== Inspecting printed stacktraces

Some of the errors you encounter as a Clojurists aren't necessarily
evaluation errors that happened in your REPL. Many times, you see
errors printed in a textual representation in other buffers as well,
like log files or the REPL for example. Cider can parse and analyze
some of those printed errors as well and show them in
`cider-stacktrace-mode` with the following commands:

* The `cider-stacktrace-analyze-at-point` command uses the `thingatpt`
  library to extract the current stacktrace at point. It sends the
  extracted stacktrace to the middleware in order to parse and analyze
  it, and then shows the result in Cider's `cider-stacktrace-mode`.

* The `cider-stacktrace-analyze-in-region` command does the same as
  `cider-stacktrace-analyze-at-point`, but uses the current region to
  extract the stacktrace.

===== Examples

Here is an example of a stacktrace printed with the Java
`printStackTrace` method:

[source,text]
----
clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: BOOM-1 {:boom "1"}
  at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)
----

To open this stacktrace in the Cider stacktrace inspector, move point
somewhere over the exception and run `M-x
cider-stacktrace-analyze-at-point`.

This also works to some extend for exceptions that are buried inside a
string like the following exception:

[source,text]
----
"clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: BOOM-1 {:boom \"1\"}\n at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)"
----

Those exceptions are often hard to read. The Cider stacktrace
inspector can help you navigating exceptions even in those cases.

===== Supported formats

Cider recognizes stacktraces printed in the following formats:

- `Aviso` - Exceptions printed with the
  https://ioavisopretty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exceptions.html[write-exception]
  function of the https://github.com/AvisoNovate/pretty[Aviso]
  library.

- `clojure.repl` - Exceptions printed with the
  https://clojure.github.io/clojure/branch-master/clojure.repl-api.html#clojure.repl/pst[clojure.repl/pst]
  function.

- `clojure.stacktrace` - Exceptions printed with the
  https://clojure.github.io/clojure/branch-master/clojure.stacktrace-api.html#clojure.stacktrace/print-cause-trace[clojure.stacktrace/print-cause-trace]
  function.

- `Java` - Exceptions printed with the
  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html#printStackTrace--[Throwable/printStackTrace]
  method.

- `Tagged Literal` - Exceptions printed with the
  https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/pr[clojure.core/pr]
  function.

===== Limitations

- Cider only recognizes stacktraces that have been printed in one of
  the supported formats.

- The buffers in which `cider-stacktrace-analyze-at-point` or
  `cider-stacktrace-analyze-in-region` are called in, must have a
  Cider session associated with them. Tip: Use
  `sesman-link-with-project` and friends in case the buffer containing
  the exception is not linked to a Cider session.

- Stacktraces are analyzed with the classpath of the Cider session the
  buffer is associated with. If the stacktrace contains references to
  classes not on this classpath, some information might be missing
  from the analysis.

- The `cider-stacktrace-analyze-at-point` function might not detect
  the stacktrace at point in every situation. The thing at point might
  be different depending on which major mode is active in a
  buffer. When `cider-stacktrace-analyze-at-point` fails to detect the
  stacktrace, `cider-stacktrace-analyze-in-region` can be used to
  select the stacktrace manually.
