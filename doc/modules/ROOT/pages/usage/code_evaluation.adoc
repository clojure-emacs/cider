= Code Evaluation

Code evaluation is at the heart of interactive programming.
CIDER provides a ton of evaluation-related commands that can cover
just about any use-case one can possibly imagine.

TIP: All evaluation commands are defined in `cider-eval.el`.

== Terminology

CIDER's evaluation commands use a terminology that's popular within Emacs, but somewhat
confusing to people not familiar with it. Let's take a look at it:

* `defun` - top-level expression
* `sexp` - s-expression, form
* `last-sexp` - the form preceding the cursor (`point` in Emacs lingo)
* `sexp-at-point` - the form under/around the cursor
* `buffer` - the abstraction used by Emacs to represent any content; most often backed by a file.
* `region` - the selected part of a buffer
* `load` - a synonym for "evaluate"; most often used in the context of buffers/files

== Basic Evaluation

As CIDER derives almost all of its functionality by inspecting the runtime (REPL) state
of your application, you need to evaluate something before functionality like code completion,
`eldoc` or definition lookup would work.

Typically the first think you'd do when visiting a Clojure buffer would be to load (evaluate) the buffer with `cider-load-buffer` (kbd:[C-c C-k]).

Afterwards most of the time you'd be evaluating expressions one at a time either using
`cider-eval-last-sexp` (kbd:[C-c C-e] or kbd:[C-x C-e]) or `cider-eval-defun-at-point`
(kbd:[C-c C-c] or kbd:[C-M-x]).

.What happens if I don't evaluate the entire buffer first?
****
You might be wondering why do you need to evaluate the entire source buffer. After all,
won't be it be nice if you could just start evaluating only the forms you're interested in?

Technically speaking you're not required to evaluate the entire source buffer first, but not
doing so introduces some subtleties and a bit of complexity. In general the only
part that's really essential for subsequent code evaluations is the `ns` declaration. As expressions within the buffer
are evaluated in the context of its namespace and you have to create that namespace first.

In the early days of CIDER, when a namespace didn't exist CIDER would just throw
an error. A lot of people were confused by this behavior and unhappy
about it. Eventually CIDER became smarter and now it always knows whether the `ns`
form in some source buffer has been evaluated or changed after it was originally
evaluated.  With that knowledge in hand CIDER will auto-eval `ns` forms that
were changed prior to evaluating code in that namespace, if you don't evaluate
them yourselves. That behavior is controlled via the variable
`cider-auto-track-ns-form-changes`.
****

Typically this type of evaluation commands would provide you with dual feedback -
you'd see the results in both the Emacs minibuffer and in an inline overlay in
the source buffer.

In case the result of the evaluation is big (e.g. a map with dozens of keys) it might be best
to display it in a dedicated buffer. You can do this with
`cider-pprint-eval-last-sexp` (kbd:[C-c C-p]). As a bonus -
the result will be pretty-printed in the result buffer.

.Why aren't results always pretty-printed?
****
Many people might be wondering why doesn't CIDER pretty-print all of the results
all of the time. After all - pretty-printed results are always easier to read, right?

The reason for not doing this is pretty simple - multi-line results don't look
very good in the minibuffer and overlays.  That's why there's little point in
pretty-printing results there.

As most of the time you'll know in advance what kind of result to expect, we feel it's
best to leave it to you to decide which evaluation command to use depending on the situation.

== Exotic Evaluation Commands

NOTE: WIP

While the basic evaluation commands discussed earlier should be enough for
most people, CIDER features a ton of additional evaluation commands.
Some of them are so peculiar that one can easily label them "exotic".
This section will briefly go over some of them.

Broadly speaking the exotic evaluation commands can be grouped in the following
categories:

- commands that are a variation of some basic commands (e.g. `cider-eval-list-at-point` and `cider-eval-sexp-at-point`)
- commands that insert the result in the current buffer (e.g. `cider-eval-last-sexp-and-replace`)
- commands that evaluate an expression in a different context (e.g. with user-supplied bindings)
- commands that evaluate some particular part of a buffer (e.g. `cider-eval-ns-form`)

Most of the exotic evaluation commands don't have "top-level" keybindings
and should be accessed via CIDER's evaluation commands keymap (`cider-eval-commands-map`), meaning that they share the standard prefix `C-c C-v`. On top of this - several
related commands that pretty-print their result are grouped under `C-c C-v C-f`.

== Evaluating Clojure Code in the Minibuffer

You can evaluate Clojure code in the minibuffer at almost any time
using kbd:[M-x] `cider-read-and-eval` (bound in `cider-mode` buffers to
kbd:[C-c M-:]).  kbd:[TAB] completion will work in the minibuffer,
just as in REPL and source buffers.

TIP: Typing kbd:[C-c C-v .] in a Clojure buffer will insert the defun
at point into the minibuffer for evaluation. This way you can pass arguments
to the function and evaluate it and see the result in the minibuffer.

You can also enable other convenient modes in the minibuffer. For
instance, you might want to have both `eldoc-mode` and `paredit-mode`
available to you:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook #'eldoc-mode)
(add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook #'paredit-mode)
----

== Evaluation Hooks

You can use `cider-file-loaded-hook` to trigger some action after a
file has been evaluated.

TIP: `cider-auto-test-mode` is implemented in terms of this hook -
tests are re-run every time you evaluate a file.

== Synchronous vs Asynchronous Evaluation

nREPL has an asynchronous evaluation model, where eval requests
are enqueued and the responses are sent back to the clients when available.
This model works great most of the time as doesn't require clients
to block while waiting for responses, but it also requires the clients
to able to handle comfortably response callbacks.

Unfortunately, some of Emacs's internal APIs don't play well with asynchronous
evaluation (e.g. completion, eldoc, etc) and in those cases CIDER simulates
synchronous evaluation instead. It's important to understand several things:

* CIDER's sync eval commands should be used sparingly
* The most common use case for the sync eval API is evaluating some simple and fast to run tooling-related code
* Sync eval may result in client lock-ups, as Emacs is (mostly) single-threaded by design

CIDER tries to mitigate the latter by imposing a 10 second eval request timeout
for sync eval. You can adjust this default if needed:

[source,lisp]
----
;; increase the sync request timeout to 1 minute
(setq nrepl-sync-request-timeout 60)

;; disable sync request timeout
(setq nrepl-sync-request-timeout nil)
----

NOTE: CIDER internally increases the timeout to 30 seconds for the first sync eval request it does, as it might require a lot of namespaces and take more time to complete. See `cider--prep-interactive-eval` for details.

== Configuration

=== Overlays

When you evaluate code in Clojure files, the result is displayed in the buffer
itself, in an overlay right after the evaluated code.  If you want this overlay
to be font-locked (syntax-highlighted) like Clojure code, set the following
variable.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-overlays-use-font-lock t)
----

You can disable overlays entirely (and display results in the echo-area at the
bottom) with the `cider-use-overlays` variable.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-use-overlays nil)
----

By default, result overlays are displayed at the end of the line. You can set
the variable `cider-result-overlay-position` to display results at the end of
their respective forms instead.
Note that this also affects the position of debugger overlays.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-result-overlay-position 'at-point)
----

=== Auto-Save Clojure Buffers on Load

Normally, CIDER prompts you to save a modified Clojure buffer when you
type kbd:[C-c C-k] (`cider-load-buffer`).  You can change this
behavior by adjusting `cider-save-file-on-load`.

Don't prompt and don't save:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-save-file-on-load nil)
----

Just save without prompting:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-save-file-on-load t)
----

=== Change the Result Prefix for Interactive Evaluation

Change the result prefix for interactive evaluation (not the REPL
prefix). By default the prefix is `=> `.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-eval-result-prefix ";; => ")
----

To remove the prefix altogether, just set it to the empty string (`""`).

=== Change the Output Destination

By default CIDER will display the output produced by some evaluation in the REPL buffer, but you can also funnel the output to a dedicated buffer. You can configure this behavior via `cider-interactive-eval-output-destination`.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-interactive-eval-output-destination 'output-buffer)
----

Additionally, there's the variable `cider-redirect-server-output-to-repl` that captures output that would normally end up in the `*nrepl-server*` buffer (provided it has been started via `cider-jack-in`) and redirects it to the REPL buffer. You can disable this redirection like this:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-redirect-server-output-to-repl nil)
----

NOTE: The redirection functionality is implemented in `cider-nrepl` as nREPL middleware. If you're using CIDER without `cider-nrepl` no output redirection is going to take place.

== Keybindings

You might have noticed that CIDER typically has 2-3 different keybindings for
many evaluation commands. In case you've been wondering "Why?" the answer is
pretty simple - legacy. The principle sources of inspiration for CIDER, Emacs and SLIME,
provide more or less the same functionality, but use different keybindings. CIDER
tried to find a common ground by adopting them both.

On top of this, at some when it became clear that CIDER has set the world record
for evaluation command, we've introduced a dedicated keymap for all eval commands
(that's everything with the prefix kbd:[C-c C-v]). This leads to funny situations
like `cider-eval-defun-at-point` having 3 keybindings:

* kbd:[C-M-x] (Emacs style)
* kbd:[C-c C-c] (SLIME style)
* kbd:[C-c C-v (C-)d] (CIDER style)

Okay, those are technically 4 keybindings, but who's counting!

NOTE: Some of you are probably wonder why kbd:[C-c C-v] instead of
kbd:[C-c C-e], right? Again - legacy. Historically kbd:[C-c C-e]
was mapped to `cider-eval-last-sexp`, otherwise we would have picked
this binding. It's still possible to recycle it down the road, as
most people are probably using kbd:[C-x C-e] for `cider-eval-last-result`
and good keybindings are too precious to be wasted like this.

Below is a listing of most keybindings for evaluation commands:
