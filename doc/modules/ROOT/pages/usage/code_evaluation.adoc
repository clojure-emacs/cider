= Code Evaluation

Code evaluation is at the heart of interactive programming.
CIDER provides a ton of evaluation-related commands that can cover
just about any use-case one can possibly imagine.

TIP: All evaluation commands are defined in `cider-eval.el`.

== Terminology

CIDER's evaluation commands use a terminology that's popular within Emacs, but somewhat
confusing to people not familiar with it. Let's take a look at it:

* `defun` - top-level expression
* `sexp` - s-expression, form
* `last-sexp` - the form preceding the cursor (`point` in Emacs lingo)
* `sexp-at-point` - the form under/around the cursor
* `buffer` - the abstraction used by Emacs to represent any content; most often backed by a file.
* `region` - the selected part of a buffer
* `load` - a synonym for "evaluate"; most often used in the context of buffers/files

== Basic Evaluation

As CIDER derives almost all of its functionality by inspecting the runtime (REPL) state
of your application, you need to evaluate something before functionality like code completion,
`eldoc` or definition lookup would work.

Typically the first think you'd do when visiting a Clojure buffer would be to load (evaluate) the buffer with `cider-load-buffer` (kbd:[C-c C-k]).

Afterwards most of the time you'd be evaluating expressions one at a time either using
`cider-eval-last-sexp` (kbd:[C-c C-e] or kbd:[C-x C-e]) or `cider-eval-defun-at-point`
(kbd:[C-c C-c] or kbd:[C-M-x]).

.What happens if I don't evaluate the entire buffer first?
****
You might be wondering why do you need to evaluate the entire source buffer. After all,
won't be it be nice if you could just start evaluating only the forms you're interested in?

Technically speaking you're not required to evaluate the entire source buffer first, but not
doing so introduces some subtleties and a bit of complexity. In general the only
part that's really essential for subsequent code evaluations is the `ns` declaration. As expressions within the buffer
are evaluated in the context of its namespace and you have to create that namespace first.

In the early days of CIDER, when a namespace didn't exist CIDER would just throw
an error. A lot of people were confused by this behavior and unhappy
about it. Eventually CIDER became smarter and now it always knows whether the `ns`
form in some source buffer has been evaluated or changed after it was originally
evaluated.  With that knowledge in hand CIDER will auto-eval `ns` forms that
were changed prior to evaluating code in that namespace, if you don't evaluate
them yourselves. That behavior is controlled via the variable
`cider-auto-track-ns-form-changes`.
****

Typically this type of evaluation commands would provide you with dual feedback -
you'd see the results in both the Emacs minibuffer and in an inline overlay in
the source buffer.

== Evaluating Clojure Code in the Minibuffer

You can evaluate Clojure code in the minibuffer at almost any time
using kbd:[M-x] `cider-read-and-eval` (bound in `cider-mode` buffers to
kbd:[C-c M-:]).  kbd:[TAB] completion will work in the minibuffer,
just as in REPL and source buffers.

TIP: Typing kbd:[C-c C-v .] in a Clojure buffer will insert the defun
at point into the minibuffer for evaluation. This way you can pass arguments
to the function and evaluate it and see the result in the minibuffer.

You can also enable other convenient modes in the minibuffer. For
instance, you might want to have both `eldoc-mode` and `paredit-mode`
available to you:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook #'eldoc-mode)
(add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook #'paredit-mode)
----

== Evaluation Hooks

NOTE: WIP

== Configuration

=== Overlays

When you evaluate code in Clojure files, the result is displayed in the buffer
itself, in an overlay right after the evaluated code.  If you want this overlay
to be font-locked (syntax-highlighted) like Clojure code, set the following
variable.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-overlays-use-font-lock t)
----

You can disable overlays entirely (and display results in the echo-area at the
bottom) with the `cider-use-overlays` variable.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-use-overlays nil)
----

By default, result overlays are displayed at the end of the line. You can set
the variable `cider-result-overlay-position` to display results at the end of
their respective forms instead.
Note that this also affects the position of debugger overlays.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-result-overlay-position 'at-point)
----

=== Auto-Save Clojure Buffers on Load

Normally, CIDER prompts you to save a modified Clojure buffer when you
type kbd:[C-c C-k] (`cider-load-buffer`).  You can change this
behavior by adjusting `cider-save-file-on-load`.

Don't prompt and don't save:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-save-file-on-load nil)
----

Just save without prompting:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-save-file-on-load t)
----

=== Change the Result Prefix for Interactive Evaluation

Change the result prefix for interactive evaluation (not the REPL
prefix). By default the prefix is `=> `.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-eval-result-prefix ";; => ")
----

To remove the prefix altogether, just set it to the empty string (`""`).

== Keybindings

You might have noticed that CIDER typically has 2-3 different keybindings for
many evaluation commands. In case you've been wondering "Why?" the answer is
pretty simple - legacy. The principle sources of inspiration for CIDER, Emacs and SLIME,
provide more or less the same functionality, but use different keybindings. CIDER
tried to find a common ground by adopting them both.

On top of this, at some when it became clear that CIDER has set the world record
for evaluation command, we've introduced a dedicated keymap for all eval commands
(that's everything with the prefix kbd:[C-c C-v]). This leads to funny situations
like `cider-eval-defun-at-point` having 3 keybindings:

* kbd:[C-M-x] (Emacs style)
* kbd:[C-c C-c] (SLIME style)
* kbd:[C-c C-v (C-)d] (CIDER style)

Okay, those are technically 4 keybindings, but who's counting!

Below is a listing of most keybindings for evaluation commands:

|===
| Command | Keyboard shortcut | Description

| `cider-eval-last-sexp`
| kbd:[C-x C-e]
| Evaluate the form preceding point and display the result in the echo area and/or in an buffer overlay (according to `cider-use-overlays`).  If invoked with a prefix argument, insert the result into the current buffer.

| `cider-eval-last-sexp-or-re-eval-previous-sexp`
| kbd:[C-c C-e]
| Evaluate the form preceding point like `cider-eval-last-sexp` unless invoked with a prefix argument, in which case it will evaluate the previously evaluated expression. This includes any context stored by commands like `cider-eval-last-sexp-in-context`.

| `cider-eval-last-sexp-in-context`
| kbd:[C-c C-v C-c] +
kbd:[C-c C-v c]
| Eval the form preceding point with a containing lexical scope. The context is defined interactively in the minibuffer and evaluated as if provided in as `let` bindings surrounding the form to be evaluated. Useful for debugging deeply nested forms.

| `cider-eval-last-sexp-and-replace`
| kbd:[C-c C-v w]
| Evaluate the form preceding point and replace it with its result.

| `cider-eval-last-sexp-to-repl`
| kbd:[C-c M-e]
| Evaluate the form preceding point and output it result to the REPL buffer.  If invoked with a prefix argument, takes you to the REPL buffer after being invoked.

| `cider-insert-last-sexp-in-repl`
| kbd:[C-u C-c M-p]
| Load the form preceding point in the REPL buffer and eval.

| `cider-pprint-eval-last-sexp`
| kbd:[C-c C-v C-f e]
| Evaluate the form preceding point and pretty-print the result in a popup buffer. If invoked with a prefix argument, insert the result into the current buffer as a comment.

| `cider-pprint-eval-defun-at-point`
| kbd:[C-c C-v C-f d]
| Evaluate the top level form under point and pretty-print the result in a popup buffer. If invoked with a prefix argument, insert the result into the current buffer as a comment.

| `cider-eval-defun-at-point`
| kbd:[C-M-x] +
kbd:[C-c C-c]
| Evaluate the top level form under point and display the result in the echo area.

| `cider-eval-list-at-point`
| kbd:[C-c C-v l] +
kbd:[C-c C-v C-l]
| Evaluate the list around point.

| `cider-eval-sexp-at-point`
| kbd:[C-c C-v v] +
kbd:[C-c C-v C-v]
| Evaluate the form around point.

| `cider-eval-defun-at-point`
| kbd:[C-u C-M-x] +
kbd:[C-u C-c C-c]
| Debug the top level form under point and walk through its evaluation

| `cider-eval-defun-up-to-point`
| kbd:[C-c C-v z]
| Evaluate the preceding top-level form up to the point.

| `cider-eval-region`
| kbd:[C-c C-v r]
| Evaluate the region and display the result in the echo area.

| `cider-interrupt`
| kbd:[C-c C-b]
| Interrupt any pending evaluations.

| `cider-eval-ns-form`
| kbd:[C-c C-v n]
| Eval the ns form.

| `cider-load-buffer-and-switch-to-repl-buffer`
| kbd:[C-c M-z]
| Load (eval) the current buffer and switch to the relevant REPL buffer. Use a prefix argument to change the namespace of the REPL buffer to match the currently visited source file.

| `cider-load-buffer`
| kbd:[C-c C-k]
| Load (eval) the current buffer.

| `cider-load-file`
| kbd:[C-c C-l]
| Load (eval) a Clojure file.

| `cider-load-all-files`
| kbd:[C-c C-M-l]
| Load (eval) all Clojure files below a directory.
