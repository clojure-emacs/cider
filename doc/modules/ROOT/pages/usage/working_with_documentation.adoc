= Working with Documentation

Quick access to documentation is very important for productive
development. That's why CIDER puts a heavy emphasis on this
and provides lot of documentation-related functionality.

== Looking up Documentation

The most basic thing that you can do is go to some symbol and
press kbd:[C-c C-d C-d] then. This open a documentation buffer
containing all the relevant information about the thing referenced
by the symbol (special form, var, Java method, etc).

== JavaDoc

CIDER provides a quick access to the online Javadoc documentation
via the command `cider-javadoc`.

This requires `enrich-classpath` to be enabled.

== ClojureDocs

CIDER provides integration with the popular https://clojuredocs.org/[ClojureDocs service].
You've got two main ways of interacting with ClojureDocs:

* displaying the documentation in a dedicated buffer in Emacs via `cider-clojuredocs` (kbd:[C-c C-d C-c])
* opening the documentation in your default browser via `cider-clojuredocs-web` (kbd:[C-c C-d C-w])

The documentation is bundled with `cider-nrepl` as an EDN resource (or more
precisely - with `orchard`, which is dependency of `cider-nrepl`) and it's a
snapshot of the ClojureDocs data. You can update it manually to the most recent
version with `M-x cider-clojuredocs-refresh-cache`.

Keep in mind that the documentation in ClojureDocs is limited only to Clojure and a few
Clojure Contrib libraries (e.g. `core.async`). ClojureScript is currently not supported
there.

TIP: Check out https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/14/exporting-clojuredocs-as-edn.html[this article] if you're curious about the internals of how CIDER interacts with ClojureDocs.

== Generating Documentation Cross References

Sometimes in your documentation strings, you'd like to be able to
point other programmers at different definitions. If you specify the
name of a definition as a fully qualified symbol, or surround it in
backticks (`++`...`++`) or Codox-style delimiters (`+[[...]]+`), CIDER
will convert these references into live links when it displays the
documentation string in the documentation buffer.

If the name is in another namespace, then you'll have to include the
fully qualified name in the docstring.

Example function with a docstring containing references:

----
(defn test-fn
  "Test function.
  Also see: clojure.core/map, clojure.core/reduce, `defn`.
  You can reference variables like `thor`, [[kubaru.data.zookeeper/yoda]].
  Also works with references to java interop forms, `java.lang.String/.length`."
  []
  (+ 1 1))
----

You can change the delimiters that CIDER uses to find references if
you want to support other reference formats.  Simply update the regexp in
`cider-doc-xref-regexp` to match your preferred format. The first
group of the regexp should always match the cross-reference name. For
example, if you want to want to use Latex-style references
(`+\ref{...}+`) instead, the regexp would be:

----
(setq cider-doc-xref-regexp "\\\\ref{\\(?1:[^}]+\\)}")
----
