= Using cider-mode
:experimental:

`cider-mode` is a pretty standard Emacs minor mode, which exists mostly to provide a
common keymap for all of CIDER's REPL-powered commands that are meant to be used
from Clojure(Script) source buffers.

There you'll find commands for evaluation, code and documentation lookup, debugging and
other related functionality. This mode is the very heart of CIDER and it's important to master
it, so you can be productive.

== Enabling cider-mode

`cider-mode` is normally enabled automatically when you start CIDER, but you can also enable it explicitly for Clojure(Script) buffers like this:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'cider-mode)
----

or if you are using `clojure-ts-mode`:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'clojure-ts-mode-hook #'cider-mode)
----

NOTE: There's no need to enable it explicitly for modes derived from `clojure-mode` or `clojure-ts-mode` like `clojurescript-mode` and `clojure-ts-clojurescript-mode`.

== Disabling cider-mode

`cider-mode` is normally disabled automatically when you quit CIDER, but you can also disable it in any buffer explicitly by typing `M-x cider-mode` (provided it's already enabled in that buffer).

== Basic Workflow

Typically you'd begin your interaction with any source buffer by evaluating it with kbd:[C-c C-k].
Afterwards you'd normally evaluate just individual forms with kbd:[C-c C-e] (evaluate preceding form) or kbd:[C-c C-c] (evaluate current top-level form).

From time to time some evaluation would take forever and you'd interrupt it with kbd:[C-c C-b].

Jumping between source files and the REPL is as easy as pressing kbd:[C-c C-z]. If you invoke the command with a kbd:[C-u]
prefix, while in a source buffer, it will also change the namespace of the REPL buffer to match that of the source buffer.

It's also highly likely that you'd look up some definition with kbd:[M-.] or some documentation with kbd:[C-c C-d C-d].

TIP: Definition and documentation lookup commands work with both Java and Clojure.

If you're struggling to remember the name of some var you need, `cider-apropos` (kbd:[C-c C-d a] or kbd:[C-c C-d C-a])
and `cider-apropos-documentation` (kbd:[C-c C-d f] or kbd:[C-c C-d C-f]) will help you find vars matching some string.

`cider-mode` also provides you with code completion that works out-of-the-box and requires no extra setup and `eldoc` integration.

Those few essential commands can get you really far in your day to day work. Keep on reading for a lot more information!

[TIP]
====
There's no need to memorize this list. If you're in a Clojure buffer with `cider-mode`
active you'll have a CIDER menu available. The menu lists all the most important
commands and their keybindings. You can also invoke kbd:[C-h f RET cider-mode] to
get a list of the keybindings for `cider-mode`.

image::menu_example.png[CIDER interactions menu]

An even better solution would be to install https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key[which-key], which will
automatically show you a list of available keybindings as you start typing some
keys. This will simplify your interactions with CIDER quite a lot,
especially in
the beginning. Here's what you'd see if you typed kbd:[C-c C-d] in a
Clojure buffer:
