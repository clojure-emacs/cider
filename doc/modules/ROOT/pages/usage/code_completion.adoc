= Code Completion
:experimental:

CIDER provides intelligent code completion for both source buffers (powered by
`cider-mode`) and REPL buffers.

NOTE: Internally CIDER leverages
https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment[compliment] for Clojure and
https://github.com/rkms/clj-suitable[clj-suitable] for ClojureScript.
Improvements to the two libraries automatically translate to improvements in CIDER.

== Standard completion

Out-of-the box CIDER uses the standard Emacs tooling for code completion. When you
press kbd:[TAB] or kbd:[M-TAB] you'll get completion candidates in a
dedicated buffer.

[NOTE]
====
There are two things to keep in mind about the standard completion:

1. The default keybinding kbd:[M-TAB] is not usable in desktop environments that
use it for switching between open applications.
2. You have to configure kbd:[TAB] to do completion manually by adding this snippet your Emacs config:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
----

Normally kbd:[TAB] only indents, but now it will also do completion if the code
is already properly indented.
====

== Auto-completion

While the standard Emacs tooling works just fine, we suggest that
CIDER users consider using
http://company-mode.github.io/[`company-mode`] instead. Company
can be used for auto-completion in both source code and REPL buffers.
To install `company-mode`:

kbd:[M-x] `package-install` kbd:[RET] `company` kbd:[RET]

After installation, you can turn on `company-mode` globally:

[source,lisp]
----
(global-company-mode)
----

or through mode-specific hooks:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook #'company-mode)
(add-hook 'cider-mode-hook #'company-mode)
----

When `company-mode` is enabled, it will receive completion information
from `cider-complete-at-point` and requires no additional setup or plugins.

If you'd prefer to trigger completions manually you can add this to your config:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq company-idle-delay nil) ; never start completions automatically
(global-set-key (kbd "M-TAB") #'company-complete) ; use M-TAB, a.k.a. C-M-i, as manual trigger
----

To make kbd:[TAB] complete, without losing the ability to manually indent,
you can add this to your config:

[source,lisp]
----
(global-set-key (kbd "TAB") #'company-indent-or-complete-common)
----

=== Fuzzy candidate matching

By default `company-mode` will provide completion candidates with the
assumption that whatever you've typed so far is a prefix of what
you're really trying to type. For example, if you type `map-` then
you'll only get completion candidates that have `map-` as the
beginning of their names.  Sometimes, you don't know the exact prefix
for the item you want to type. In this case, you can get
CIDER-specific "fuzzy completion" by adding:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook #'cider-company-enable-fuzzy-completion)
(add-hook 'cider-mode-hook #'cider-company-enable-fuzzy-completion)
----

Now, `company-mode` will accept certain fuzziness when matching
candidates against the prefix. For example, typing `mi` will show you
`map-indexed` as one of the possible completion candidates and `cji`
will complete to `clojure.java.io`. Different completion examples are
shown
https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples[here].

=== Completion annotations

Completion candidates will be annotated by default with an abbreviation
corresponding to their type, and (contextually) their namespace. The function
used to format the annotation can be configured by
`cider-annotate-completion-function.` The abbreviations used are configured by
`cider-completion-annotations-alist` and the context in which their namespace is
included is configured by `cider-completion-annotations-include-ns.`

TIP: Completion annotations can be disabled by setting
`cider-annotate-completion-candidates` to `nil`.

=== Updating stale classes and methods cache

Sometimes, the completion fails to recognize new classes that came with
dependencies that were loaded dynamically after the REPL was started (e.g. via
Boot). Executing `M-x cider-completion-flush-caches` (or going through the menu
`+CIDER Interaction->Misc->Flush completion cache+`) forces the completion backend
to re-read all classes it can find on the classpath.

== Implementation Details

NOTE: You don't really need to know any of this if you're using only `cider-jack-in`.

The bulk of the code completion logic resides in `cider-nrepl` https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/blob/master/src/cider/nrepl/middleware/complete.clj[completion middleware]. Internally it delegates to `compliment` for the Clojure completion and `clj-suitable` for the ClojureScript completion.

Starting with nREPL 0.8, there's also a built-in `completions` nREPL op that CIDER will fallback to, in the absence of `cider-nrepl`. Its API is similar to that of the `complete` op in `cider-nrepl` and it can be configured to use different completion functions. The built-in op currently supports only Clojure. See the https://nrepl.org/nrepl/usage/misc.html#code-completion[nREPL docs] for more details.

Basically, you'll get great code completion in the presence of `cider-nrepl` and basic completion otherwise.
