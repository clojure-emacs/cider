= Code Completion
:experimental:

CIDER provides intelligent code completion for both source buffers (powered by
`cider-mode`) and REPL buffers.

NOTE: Internally CIDER leverages
https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment[compliment] for Clojure and
https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-suitable[clj-suitable] for ClojureScript.

Improvements to the two libraries automatically translate to improvements in CIDER.

== Standard completion

Out-of-the box CIDER uses the standard Emacs tooling for code completion. When you
press kbd:[TAB] or kbd:[M-TAB] you'll get completion candidates in a
dedicated buffer.

[NOTE]
====
There are two things to keep in mind about the standard completion:

1. The default keybinding kbd:[M-TAB] is not usable in desktop environments that
use it for switching between open applications.
2. You have to configure kbd:[TAB] to do completion manually by adding this snippet your Emacs config:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq tab-always-indent 'complete)
----

Normally kbd:[TAB] only indents, but now it will also do completion if the code
is already properly indented.
====

== Completion styles

CIDER defines a specialized completion category through the `cider-complete-at-point` function,
added to `completion-at-point-functions`, establishing a dedicated completion category named
`cider`.

The CIDER completion at point function supports most completion styles,
including `partial-completion`, `orderless` and `flex`. It also supports a
custom completion style that is confusingly named `cider` too. Activating it
provides a richer set of completion candidates (see
xref:usage/code_completion.adoc#fuzzy-candidate-matching[fuzzy candidate
matching]).

Sometimes the user may want to use a different completion style just for the CIDER
complete at point function. That can be achieved by setting
`completion-category-overrides`, overwriting the completion style of the CIDER
complete at point function. The following snippet accomplishes that:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-to-list 'completion-category-overrides '(cider (styles basic)))
----

This specifies that the `cider` completion category should employ the basic completion style by
default.

== Auto-completion

While the standard Emacs tooling works just fine, we suggest that
CIDER users consider using
http://company-mode.github.io/[`company-mode`] or https://github.com/minad/corfu[`corfu-mode`] instead. These
can be used for auto-completion in both source code and REPL buffers, with the following advantages:

* A nicer UI.
* Integration with Clojure docstrings and Java doc comments.

=== Configuration

Both company-mode and corfu-mode are affected by the following CIDER configuration options:

* `cider-docstring-max-lines` (default `20`) controls how many lines, at most, of this docstring
will be included (in a popup or the echo area, depending on your setup) while offering completions.
It's worth noting, for Java documentation, CIDER doesn't simply trim lines,
but it looks at the structure and tries to find the largest combination of these that fits into `cider-docstring-max-lines`:
 ** The entire comment body, followed by its "block tags" (Returns/Throws/Params information)
 ** The first sentence of the comment, followed by the block tags
 ** The block tags
 ** The first sentence of the comment.

=== company-mode installation

To install `company-mode`:

kbd:[M-x] `package-install` kbd:[RET] `company` kbd:[RET]

After installation, you can turn on `company-mode` globally:

[source,lisp]
----
(global-company-mode)
----

or through mode-specific hooks:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook #'company-mode)
(add-hook 'cider-mode-hook #'company-mode)
----

When `company-mode` is enabled, it will receive completion information
from `cider-complete-at-point` and requires no additional setup or plugins.

If you'd prefer to trigger completions manually you can add this to your config:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq company-idle-delay nil) ; never start completions automatically
(global-set-key (kbd "M-TAB") #'company-complete) ; use M-TAB, a.k.a. C-M-i, as manual trigger
----

To make kbd:[TAB] complete, without losing the ability to manually indent,
you can add this to your config:

[source,lisp]
----
(global-set-key (kbd "TAB") #'company-indent-or-complete-common)
----

Company's documentation mechanism and CIDER's documentation facilities are integrated.

While a completion is being offered to you, you can hit (kbd:[F1])
(the default `company-show-doc-buffer` key binding) for displaying documentation
and arglists under a temporary `*cider-doc*` buffer.

In order for Company to always show docstrings and other metadata under a temporary `*cider-doc*` buffer,
without needing to hit an extra key, please customize:

[source,lisp]
----
;; (You may want to do this as a setq-local within a clojure-mode-hook instead)
(custom-set-variables '(company-auto-update-doc t))
----

=== Fuzzy candidate matching

By default, CIDER will use the completion styles defined in
`completion-styles`, the defaults being `(basic partial-completion
emacs22)` since Emacs 23. For a better description of how those
completion styles operates, refer to the official Emacs manual on
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Completion-Styles.html[how completion alternatives are chosen].

CIDER provides a function to enable the `cider` completion style for CIDER-specific
completions. If you wish to enable that, you can add this to your config:

[source,lisp]
----
(cider-enable-cider-completion-style)
----

This adds the `cider` completion style for CIDER buffers.

Now, `company-mode` (and other completion packages like `corfu`) will
accept certain fuzziness when matching candidates against the
prefix. For example, typing `mi` will show you `map-indexed` as one of
the possible completion candidates and `cji` will complete to
`clojure.java.io`. Different completion examples are shown
https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/wiki/Examples[here].

=== Completion annotations

Completion candidates will be annotated by default with an abbreviation
corresponding to their type, and (contextually) their namespace. The function
used to format the annotation can be configured by
`cider-annotate-completion-function.` The abbreviations used are configured by
`cider-completion-annotations-alist` and the context in which their namespace is
included is configured by `cider-completion-annotations-include-ns.`

image::completion-annotations.png[Completion Annotations]

TIP: Completion annotations can be disabled by setting
`cider-annotate-completion-candidates` to `nil`.

=== Notes on class disambiguation

Sometimes, the completion user experience may be interrupted by a `completing-read`
that asks for the `Member in class`. This is used for better Java completions and documentation.

However, if you are not interested in the current candidate, disambiguating it is of no use,
and the prompt can be a nuisance.

If you are using Company for completions and IDO for `completing-read`, you can cause the `<up>` and `<down>`
keys to cancel the prompt by customizing:

[source,lisp]
----
(advice-add 'cider-class-choice-completing-read
            :around
            (lambda (f a b)
              (cider--with-temporary-ido-keys "<up>" "<down>"
                (funcall f a b))))
----

=== Updating stale classes and methods cache

Sometimes, the completion fails to recognize new classes that came with
dependencies that were loaded dynamically after the REPL was started (e.g. via
Boot). Executing `M-x cider-completion-flush-caches` (or going through the menu
`+CIDER Interaction->Misc->Flush completion cache+`) forces the completion backend
to re-read all classes it can find on the classpath.

== Implementation Details

NOTE: You don't really need to know any of this if you're using only `cider-jack-in`.

The bulk of the code completion logic resides in `cider-nrepl` https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/blob/master/src/cider/nrepl/middleware/complete.clj[completion middleware]. Internally it delegates to `compliment` for the Clojure completion and `clj-suitable` for the ClojureScript completion.

Starting with nREPL 0.8, there's also a built-in `completions` nREPL op that CIDER will fallback to, in the absence of `cider-nrepl`. Its API is similar to that of the `complete` op in `cider-nrepl` and it can be configured to use different completion functions. The built-in op currently supports only Clojure. See the https://nrepl.org/nrepl/usage/misc.html#code-completion[nREPL docs] for more details.

Basically, you'll get great code completion in the presence of `cider-nrepl` and basic completion otherwise.
