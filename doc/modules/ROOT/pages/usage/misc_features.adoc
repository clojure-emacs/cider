= Miscellaneous Features
:experimental:

As the infomercials always say, "But wait, there's more!" If
simultaneous Clojure and ClojureScript REPLs, interactive programming,
code completion, stacktrace navigation, test running, and debugging
weren't enough for you, CIDER delivers several additional
features.

== Using a Scratchpad

CIDER provides a simple way to create a Clojure scratchpad via the
kbd:[M-x] `cider-scratch` command. This is a great way to play
around with some code without having to create source files or pollute
the REPL buffer and is very similar to Emacs's own `+*scratch*+` buffer.

== Find References

NOTE: The functionality is based on https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/12/11/hard-cider-find-usages.html[ideas from this article] and was
introduced in CIDER 0.22.

There are two ways to use find references in CIDER:

* `cider-xref-fn-refs` (kbd:[C-c C-? r]) shows the usages of the function at point in a dedicated buffer
* `cider-xref-fn-refs-select` (kbd:[C-c C-? C-r]) shows the usages in the minibuffer

Here's how they look in action:

image::cider_find_usages.gif[CIDER Find References]

Keep in mind the following limitations:

- This works only for Clojure
- It's powered by runtime state analysis, which means it will show only data for loaded namespaces (like most of CIDER's functionality)
- It doesn't (currently) find usages in lambdas
- It doesn't give us the precise locations where something is used, we only know that it's used

On the bright side:

- It's super fast
- It doesn't require any static code analysis
- It's still more reliable than `grep`

The functionality is not perfect, but at least it's there if you need it. As a bonus you get a quick way to navigate to
all of the functions used by some function using `cider-xref-fn-deps` (kbd:[C-c C-? d]) and `cider-xref-fn-deps-select` (kbd:[C-c C-? C-d]).
Those are pretty handy if you don't want to jump to the source of some function to see what functions it refers to (uses) internally.

Don't forget you also have a couple of third-party alternative:

- The much more sophisticated AST-powered "find usages" provided by `clj-refactor.el`
- https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile[Projectile's] "grep in project" (`projectile-grep`, typically bound to kbd:[C-c p g])

== Reloading Code

While Clojure's and CIDER's interactive programming style means you'll
restart your application far less often than with other languages and
development environments, sometimes you'll want to clean everything up
and reload one or more namespaces to ensure that they are up to date
and there are no temporary definitions hanging around.

Typing kbd:[C-c M-n r] or kbd:[C-c M-n M-r] will invoke
`cider-ns-refresh` and reload all modified Clojure files on the
classpath.

Adding a prefix argument, kbd:[C-u C-c M-n r], will reload all
the namespaces on the classpath unconditionally, regardless of their
modification status.

Adding a double prefix argument, kbd:[C-u C-u M-n r], will first
clear the state of the namespace tracker before reloading. This is
useful for recovering from some classes of error that normal reloads
would otherwise not recover from. A good example is circular
dependencies. The trade-off is that stale code from any deleted files
may not be completely unloaded.

`cider-ns-refresh` wraps
https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace[clojure.tools.namespace], and as
such the same
https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace#reloading-code-motivation[benefits]
and
https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace#reloading-code-preparing-your-application[caveats]
regarding writing reloadable code also apply.

The above three operations are analogous to
http://clojure.github.io/tools.namespace/#clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh[`clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh`],
http://clojure.github.io/tools.namespace/#clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh-all[`clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh-all`]
and
http://clojure.github.io/tools.namespace/#clojure.tools.namespace.repl/clear[`clojure.tools.namespace.repl/clear`]
(followed by a normal refresh), respectively.

You can define Clojure functions to be called before reloading, and after a
successful reload, when using `cider-ns-refresh`:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-ns-refresh-before-fn "user/stop-system!"
      cider-ns-refresh-after-fn "user/start-system!")
----

These must be set to the namespace-qualified names of vars bound to
functions of no arguments. The functions must be synchronous
(blocking), and are expected to be side-effecting - they will always
be executed serially, without retries.

By default, messages regarding the status of the in-progress reload
will be displayed in the echo area after you call
`cider-ns-refresh`. The same information will also be recorded in the
`+*cider-ns-refresh-log*+` buffer, along with anything printed to
`+*out*+` or `+*err*+` by `cider-ns-refresh-before-fn` and
`cider-ns-refresh-start-fn`.

You can make the `+*cider-ns-refresh-log*+` buffer display automatically
after you call `cider-ns-refresh` by setting the
`cider-ns-refresh-show-log-buffer` variable to a non-nil value. This
will also prevent any related messages from also being displayed in
the echo area.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-ns-refresh-show-log-buffer t)
----

By default, CIDER will prompt for whether to save all modified `clojure-mode`
buffers visiting files on the classpath. You can customize this behavior with
`cider-ns-save-files-on-refresh` and `cider-ns-save-files-on-refresh-modes`.

Sometimes, `cider-ns-refresh` may not work for you. If you're looking
for a bit more forceful reloading the `cider-ns-reload`
and `cider-ns-reload-all` commands can be used instead. These commands
invoke Clojure's `+(require ... :reload)+` and `+(require
... :reload-all)+` commands at the REPL.

== CIDER Selector

The `cider-selector` (kbd:[C-c M-s]) command allows you to quickly navigate to
important buffers in the context of a Clojure project - e.g. the REPL, the
stacktrace buffer, the doc buffer, the most recently visited Clojure file, etc.
The usage of the command is extremely simple - after invoking it you need to type a
single key identifying the target buffer (e.g. `r` for the REPL).

[TIP]
====
One thing to keep in mind about the default keybinding kbd:[C-c M-s] is that it's available only
in buffers where `cider-mode` is enabled (e.g. Clojure source buffers) and in the CIDER REPL.
If you want to have it available everywhere it might be a good idea to add a global
binding in your Emacs config:

[source,lisp]
----
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") #'cider-selector)
----
====

Here's a list of all of ``cider-selector``'s keybindings:

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[c]
| Most recently visited Clojure buffer.

| kbd:[e]
| Most recently visited Emacs Lisp buffer.

| kbd:[r]
| Current REPL buffer or most recently visited REPL buffer.

| kbd:[m]
| `+*nrepl-messages*+` buffer.

| kbd:[x]
| `+*cider-error*+` buffer.

| kbd:[d]
| `+*cider-doc*+` buffer.

| kbd:[p]
| `+*cider-profile*+` buffer.

| kbd:[s]
| `+*cider-scratch*+` buffer.

| kbd:[q]
| Abort.

| kbd:[?]
| Show help.
|===

[TIP]
====
Any of those keys can be prefixed with a `4` to make the target buffer open in a
different window (as opposed to the current one).
====

You can easily extend the selector with new commands using `def-cider-selector-method`:

[source,lisp]
----
(def-cider-selector-method ?z
  "CIDER foo buffer."
  cider-foo-buffer)
----

== Browsing the Classpath

You can easily browse the items on your classpath with the command
kbd:[M-x] `cider-classpath`.

Here you can see it in action:

image::classpath_browser.png[Classpath Browser]

Press kbd:[RET] on a classpath entry to navigate into it.

== Browsing Namespaces

You can browse the contents of any loaded namespace with the command
kbd:[M-x] `cider-browse-ns`. CIDER will prompt you for the namespace
to browse.

image::ns_browser.png[Namespace Browser]

You can also browse all available namespaces with kbd:[M-x]
`cider-browse-ns-all`.

There are a bunch of useful keybindings that are defined in browser buffers.

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[d]
| Display documentation for item at point.

| kbd:[RET]
| Browse ns or display documentation for item at point.

| kbd:[s]
| Go to definition for item at point.

| kbd:[^]
| Browse all namespaces.

| kbd:[n]
| Go to next line.

| kbd:[p]
| Go to previous line.
|===

== Browsing the Clojure Spec Registry

If you are using Clojure 1.9 or newer you can browse the Clojure spec registry.

If you already know which spec you're looking for, you can type
kbd:[M-x] `cider-browse-spec` and CIDER will prompt you for a
spec name and then drop you into the spec browser.

image::spec_browser.png[Spec Browser]

If you aren't quite sure which spec you want, you can type
kbd:[M-x] `cider-browse-spec-all`. CIDER will then prompt you for
a regex and will filter out all the spec names that don't match.

image::spec_browser_all.png[Spec Browser]

Once in the browser you can use your mouse or the keybindings below to
navigate deeper.

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[RET]
| Browse the spec at point.

| kbd:[^]
| Go up in the navigation stack.

| kbd:[n]
| Go to next spec.

| kbd:[p]
| Go to previous spec.

| kbd:[e]
| Generate an example for the current browser spec.
|===

If your project includes the `org.clojure/test.check` library, you can
type kbd:[e] when browsing a spec to generate an example that
meets the spec.

== Formatting Code with cljfmt

While CIDER has it's own code formatting (indentation) engine, you can also
use it together with `cljfmt` - that's useful if you're working on a team
that uses different editors and IDEs.

CIDER provides several commands to interact with `cljfmt`:

* `cider-format-defun`
* `cider-format-region`
* `cider-format-buffer`

Generally it's a good idea to add some hook like this one to make sure
on each save operation your buffers are properly formatted:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'cider-format-buffer t t)
----

Notice that you want to apply `cljfmt` **prior** to saving the buffer in question.

You can supply additional configuration to `cljfmt` via the configuration variable
`cider-format-code-options`. Here's an example:

[source,lisp]
----
;; Let's assume you want to pass the following config
;;
;;   {:indents {org.me/foo [[:inner 0]]}
;;    :alias-map {\"me\" \"org.me\"}}
;;
;; You'll need to encode it as an Emacs Lisp plist:

(setq cider-format-code-options
      '(("indents" (("org.me/foo" (("inner" 0)))))
        ("alias-map" (("me" "org.me")))))
----

NOTE: CIDER doesn't shell out to `cljfmt` - it interacts with it via nREPL
(there's `format` middleware in `cider-nrepl`), which is faster than
shelling out.

== Formatting EDN

Similarly to the `cljfmt` integration, CIDER also provides a convenient interface
to format EDN using `clojure.tools.reader.edn`. The following commands are provided:

* `cider-format-edn-defun`
* `cider-format-edn-region`
* `cider-format-edn-buffer`

== https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Xref.html[Xref] integration

Beginning with version 1.2.0, CIDER supports Emacs's built-in `xref`
functionality, which means `M-.` will invoke `xref-find-definitions` instead of
CIDER's own command `cider-find-var`. You can disable the use of CIDER's `xref` backend like this:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-use-xref nil)
----

NOTE: You'll have to disable and enable `cider-mode` for this setting to have effect.

If you use other packages that also integrate with xref (e.g. `lsp-mode`), you may wish to customize the precedence of CIDER's xref backend. The precedence is controlled by the
order in which backend functions appear in the `xref-backend-functions` hook. By default, the CIDER xref function will be added with a depth of -90, so it will (should?) come first.
If you would prefer for it to have a lower precedence, you can change `cider-xref-fn-depth`:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-xref-fn-depth 90)
----

TIP: See https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Setting-Hooks.html[Setting Hooks] for more information about depth.
