= Miscellaneous Features
:experimental:

As the infomercials always say, "But wait, there's more!" If
simultaneous Clojure and ClojureScript REPLs, interactive programming,
code completion, stacktrace navigation, test running, and debugging
weren't enough for you, CIDER delivers several additional
features.

== Evaluating Clojure Code in the Minibuffer

You can evaluate Clojure code in the minibuffer at almost any time
using kbd:[M-x] `cider-read-and-eval` (bound in `cider-mode` buffers to
kbd:[C-c M-:]).  kbd:[TAB] completion will work in the minibuffer,
just as in REPL and source buffers.

Typing kbd:[C-c C-v .] in a Clojure buffer will insert the defun
at point into the minibuffer for evaluation. This way you can pass arguments
to the function and evaluate it and see the result in the minibuffer.

You can also enable other convenient modes in the minibuffer. For
instance, you might want to have both `eldoc-mode` and `paredit-mode`
available to you:

[source,lisp]
----
(add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook #'eldoc-mode)
(add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook #'paredit-mode)
----

== Using a Scratchpad

CIDER provides a simple way to create a Clojure scratchpad via the
kbd:[M-x] `cider-scratch` command. This is a great way to play
around with some code without having to create source files or pollute
the REPL buffer and is very similar to Emacs's own `+*scratch*+` buffer.

== Reloading Code

While Clojure's and CIDER's interactive programming style means you'll
restart your application far less often than with other languages and
development environments, sometimes you'll want to clean everything up
and reload one or more namespaces to ensure that they are up to date
and there are no temporary definitions hanging around.

Typing kbd:[C-c M-n r] or kbd:[C-c M-n M-r] will invoke
`cider-ns-refresh` and reload all modified Clojure files on the
classpath.

Adding a prefix argument, kbd:[C-u C-c M-n r], will reload all
the namespaces on the classpath unconditionally, regardless of their
modification status.

Adding a double prefix argument, kbd:[C-u C-u M-n r], will first
clear the state of the namespace tracker before reloading. This is
useful for recovering from some classes of error that normal reloads
would otherwise not recover from. A good example is circular
dependencies. The trade-off is that stale code from any deleted files
may not be completely unloaded.

`cider-ns-refresh` wraps
https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace[clojure.tools.namespace], and as
such the same
https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace#reloading-code-motivation[benefits]
and
https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace#reloading-code-preparing-your-application[caveats]
regarding writing reloadable code also apply.

The above three operations are analogous to
http://clojure.github.io/tools.namespace/#clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh[`clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh`],
http://clojure.github.io/tools.namespace/#clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh-all[`clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh-all`]
and
http://clojure.github.io/tools.namespace/#clojure.tools.namespace.repl/clear[`clojure.tools.namespace.repl/clear`]
(followed by a normal refresh), respectively.

You can define Clojure functions to be called before reloading, and after a
successful reload, when using `cider-ns-refresh`:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-ns-refresh-before-fn "user/stop-system!"
      cider-ns-refresh-after-fn "user/start-system!")
----

These must be set to the namespace-qualified names of vars bound to
functions of no arguments. The functions must be synchronous
(blocking), and are expected to be side-effecting - they will always
be executed serially, without retries.

By default, messages regarding the status of the in-progress reload
will be displayed in the echo area after you call
`cider-ns-refresh`. The same information will also be recorded in the
`+*cider-ns-refresh-log*+` buffer, along with anything printed to
`+*out*+` or `+*err*+` by `cider-ns-refresh-before-fn` and
`cider-ns-refresh-start-fn`.

You can make the `+*cider-ns-refresh-log*+` buffer display automatically
after you call `cider-ns-refresh` by setting the
`cider-ns-refresh-show-log-buffer` variable to a non-nil value. This
will also prevent any related messages from also being displayed in
the echo area.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-ns-refresh-show-log-buffer t)
----

By default, CIDER will prompt for whether to save all modified `clojure-mode`
buffers visiting files on the classpath. You can customize this behavior with
`cider-ns-save-files-on-refresh` and `cider-ns-save-files-on-refresh-modes`.

Sometimes, `cider-ns-refresh` may not work for you. If you're looking
for a bit more forceful reloading the `cider-ns-reload`
and `cider-ns-reload-all` commands can be used instead. These commands
invoke Clojure's `+(require ... :reload)+` and `+(require
... :reload-all)+` commands at the REPL.

== CIDER Selector

The `cider-selector` (kbd:[C-c M-s]) command allows you to quickly navigate to
important buffers in the context of a Clojure project - e.g. the REPL, the
stacktrace buffer, the doc buffer, the most recently visited Clojure file, etc.
The usage of the command is extremely simple - after invoking it you need to type a
single key identifying the target buffer (e.g. `r` for the REPL).

[TIP]
====
One thing to keep in mind about the default keybinding kbd:[C-c M-s] is that it's available only
in buffers where `cider-mode` is enabled (e.g. Clojure source buffers) and in the CIDER REPL.
If you want to have it available everywhere it might be a good idea to add a global
binding in your Emacs config:

[source,lisp]
----
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") #'cider-selector)
----
====

Here's a list of all of ``cider-selector``'s keybindings:

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[c]
| Most recently visited Clojure buffer.

| kbd:[e]
| Most recently visited Emacs Lisp buffer.

| kbd:[r]
| Current REPL buffer or most recently visited REPL buffer.

| kbd:[m]
| `+*nrepl-messages*+` buffer.

| kbd:[x]
| `+*cider-error*+` buffer.

| kbd:[d]
| `+*cider-doc*+` buffer.

| kbd:[p]
| `+*cider-profiler*+` buffer.

| kbd:[s]
| `+*cider-scratch*+` buffer.

| kbd:[q]
| Abort.

| kbd:[?]
| Show help.
|===

[TIP]
====
Any of those keys can be prefixed with a `4` to make the target buffer open in a
different window (as opposed to the current one).
====

You can easily extend the selector with new commands using `def-cider-selector-method`:

[source,lisp]
----
(def-cider-selector-method ?z
  "CIDER foo buffer."
  cider-foo-buffer)
----

== Browsing the Classpath

You can easily browse the items on your classpath with the command
kbd:[M-x] `cider-classpath`.

Here you can see it in action:

image::classpath_browser.png[Classpath Browser]

Press kbd:[RET] on a classpath entry to navigate into it.

== Browsing Namespaces

You can browse the contents of any loaded namespace with the command
kbd:[M-x] `cider-browse-ns`. CIDER will prompt you for the namespace
to browse.

image::ns_browser.png[Namespace Browser]

You can also browse all available namespaces with kbd:[M-x]
`cider-browse-ns-all`.

There are a bunch of useful keybindings that are defined in browser buffers.

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[d]
| Display documentation for item at point.

| kbd:[RET]
| Browse ns or display documentation for item at point.

| kbd:[s]
| Go to definition for item at point.

| kbd:[^]
| Browse all namespaces.

| kbd:[n]
| Go to next line.

| kbd:[p]
| Go to previous line.
|===

== Browsing the Clojure Spec Registry

If you are using Clojure 1.9 or newer you can browse the Clojure spec registry.

If you already know which spec you're looking for, you can type
kbd:[M-x] `cider-browse-spec` and CIDER will prompt you for a
spec name and then drop you into the spec browser.

image::spec_browser.png[Spec Browser]

If you aren't quite sure which spec you want, you can type
kbd:[M-x] `cider-browse-spec-all`. CIDER will then prompt you for
a regex and will filter out all the spec names that don't match.

image::spec_browser_all.png[Spec Browser]

Once in the browser you can use your mouse or the keybindings below to
navigate deeper.

|===
| Keyboard shortcut | Description

| kbd:[RET]
| Browse the spec at point.

| kbd:[^]
| Go up in the navigation stack.

| kbd:[n]
| Go to next spec.

| kbd:[p]
| Go to previous spec.

| kbd:[e]
| Generate an example for the current browser spec.
|===

If your project includes the `org.clojure/test.check` library, you can
type kbd:[e] when browsing a spec to generate an example that
meets the spec.
