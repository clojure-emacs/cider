= Funding

While CIDER is free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding.
Raising a monthly budget of a couple of thousand dollars would make it possible to pay people to work on
certain complex features, fund other development related stuff (e.g. hardware, conference trips) and so on.
Raising a monthly budget of over $5000 would open the possibility of someone working full-time on the project
which would speed up the pace of development significantly.

== Funding Channels

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors! We also offer a wide array of funding channels to account
for your preferences (although currently https://opencollective.com/cider[Open Collective] is our preferred funding platform).

If you're working in a company that's making significant use of CIDER we'd appreciate it if you suggest to your company
to become a CIDER sponsor.
