Nbb's main goal is to make it easy to get started with ad hoc CLJS scripting on Node.js.

It is highly compatible with ClojureScript, so it works with CIDER out of the box.

You can either jack in to an nbb project with `M-x clojure-jack-in-cljs`.

or start its bundled nREPL server:

  $ nbb nrepl-server

and connect to it afterwards using `M-x cider-connect-cljs`.
