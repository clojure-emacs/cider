== Overview

Nbb's main goal is to make it easy to get started with ad hoc ClojureScript scripting on Node.js.

It is highly compatible with ClojureScript, so it works with CIDER out of the box.

== Usage

You can either jack in to an nbb project with `M-x clojure-jack-in-cljs`.

or start its bundled nREPL server:

  $ nbb nrepl-server

and connect to it afterwards using `M-x cider-connect-cljs`.

NOTE: `cider-jack-in-cljs` works with nbb projects that are using `nbb.edn`.

== Configuration

The jack-in command can be configured via several defcustoms:

* `cider-nbb-command` (by default `nbb`)
* `cider-nbb-parameters` (by default `nrepl-server`)
