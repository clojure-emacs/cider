= ClojureScript
:experimental:

NOTE: CIDER works well with ClojureScript, but not all CIDER features are
available in ClojureScript (yet). For instance, the test runner and
debugger are currently Clojure-only features.

Unlike the Clojure ecosystem that is dominated by Leiningen and Boot, the
ClojureScript ecosystem has a number of different choices for REPLs. You'll have
to decide which one you want to run and how you want CIDER to interact
with it. This chapter describes some of the more common choices and the
configurations required to get them working.

== Piggieback

ClojureScript support relies on the https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback[piggieback] nREPL middleware
being present in your REPL session. There's one exception to this,
though: https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs[shadow-cljs]. It has its own nREPL middleware and doesn't rely
on piggieback at all.

If `cider-inject-dependencies-at-jack-in` is enabled, which it is by
default, then piggieback will be automatically added and configured
for your project when doing `cider-jack-in-cljs`.

If `cider-inject-dependencies-at-jack-in` is disabled or you're going
to connect to an already running nREPL server using
`cider-connect-cljs`, use the configuration in the following section.

=== Manual Piggieback Setup

To setup piggieback, add the following dependencies to your project
(`project.clj` in a Leiningen based project or `build.boot` in a Boot
project or `deps.edn`):

[source,clojure]
----
;; use whatever are the most recent versions here
[cider/piggieback "0.4.2"]
[org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0"]
----

as well as `piggieback` nREPL middleware:

in `project.clj`:

[source,clojure]
----
:repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [cider.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]}
----

or in `build.boot`:

[source,clojure]
----
(task-options!
  repl {:middleware '[cider.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]})
----

or in `deps.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases { :cider-cljs { :main-opts
  ["-m" "nrepl.cmdline" "--middleware"
   "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware,cider.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]"]}}}
----

== Starting a ClojureScript REPL

Open a ClojureScript file in your project and type kbd:[M-x]
`cider-jack-in-cljs` kbd:[RET]. With the correct configuration
and after answering a few prompts this will start up the
nREPL server and create a ClojureScript REPL buffer.

NOTE: Prior to CIDER 0.18, `cider-jack-in-cljs` would create both a Clojure and
a ClojureScript REPL. In CIDER 0.18+ if you want to create both REPLs
you'll have to use `cider-jack-in-clj&cljs` instead.

When you have a combination of Clojure and ClojureScript REPLs, CIDER
will automatically direct all the usual CIDER commands to the
appropriate REPL based on whether you're currently visiting a `.clj` or
`.cljs` file.

`cider-jack-in-cljs` will prompt you for the type of ClojureScript
REPL you want to start. Keep in mind that some of the REPLs will
require you to configure additional setup. For example, you'll need to
have Node.js installed to be able to start a Node REPL.

If you frequently use the same ClojureScript REPL, you can set
`cider-default-cljs-repl` and CIDER will skip the prompt and use this
instead. For example, the following will make Nashorn the default:

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-default-cljs-repl 'nashorn)
----

All supported ClojureScript REPLs are stored in
`cider-cljs-repl-types`. If you need to extend it, you should use
`cider-register-cljs-repl-type` in your Emacs configuration.

[source,lisp]
----
(cider-register-cljs-repl-type 'super-cljs "(do (...))" optional-requirements-function)
----

You can also modify the known ClojureScript REPLs on a per-project basis using
`.dir-locals.el`:

[source,lisp]
----
;; replace the list of REPL types and set some default
((nil
  (cider-default-cljs-repl . super-cljs)
  (cider-cljs-repl-types . ((super-cljs "(do (foo) (bar))")))))
----

[source,lisp]
----
;; modify the list of known REPLs and set some default
((nil
  (eval . (cider-register-cljs-repl-type 'super-cljs "(do (foo) (bar))"))
  (cider-default-cljs-repl . super-cljs)))
----

For one-off REPLs you can also use the custom REPL init form like this:

[source,lisp]
----
;; modify the list of known REPLs and set some default
((nil
  (cider-custom-cljs-repl-init-form . "(do (foo) (bar))"
  (cider-default-cljs-repl . custom)))
----

If you already have a Clojure REPL running and want to add a
ClojureScript REPL, you can invoke
`cider-jack-in-sibling-clojurescript` to add it.

== Setting up a ClojureScript REPL

The following sections describe the configurations for several common
ClojureScript REPL use cases.

=== Browser-Connected ClojureScript REPL

Using Weasel, you can also have a browser-connected REPL.

. Add `[weasel "0.7.0"]` to your project's `:dependencies`.
. Type kbd:[M-x] `cider-jack-in-cljs` kbd:[RET] and choose
the `Weasel` option when prompted about the ClojureScript REPL type you want
to use.
. Add this to your ClojureScript code:
+
[source,clojure]
----
(ns my.cljs.core
  (:require [weasel.repl :as repl]))
(repl/connect "ws://localhost:9001")
----
+
. Open a file in your project and type kbd:[M-x] `cider-jack-in-cljs`.

Provided that a Piggieback-enabled ClojureScript environment is active in your
REPL session, code loading and evaluation will work seamlessly regardless of the
presence of the `cider-nrepl` middleware. If the middleware is present then most
other features of CIDER will also be enabled (including code completion,
documentation lookup, the namespace browser, and macroexpansion).

=== Browser-Connected ClojureScript REPL in Boot Projects

. Add this to your dependencies in `build.boot`:
+
[source,clojure]
----
[adzerk/boot-cljs        "X.Y.Z"  :scope "test"]
[adzerk/boot-cljs-repl   "X.Y.Z"  :scope "test"]
[pandeiro/boot-http      "X.Y.Z"  :scope "test"]
[weasel                  "0.7.0"  :scope "test"]
[cider/piggieback "0.4.2"  :scope "test"] ; not needed for cider-jack-in-cljs
----
+
and this at the end of `build.boot`:
+
[source,clojure]
----
(require
 '[adzerk.boot-cljs :refer [cljs]]
 '[adzerk.boot-cljs-repl :refer [cljs-repl]]
 '[pandeiro.boot-http :refer [serve]])

(deftask dev []
  (comp (serve)
        (watch)
        (cljs-repl) ; order is important!!
        (cljs)))
----
+
. Type kbd:[M-x] `customize-variable` kbd:[RET] `cider-boot-parameters`
and insert `dev`.
. Open a file in your project and type kbd:[M-x] `cider-jack-in-cljs`.
. Connect to the running server with your browser. The address is printed on the terminal, but it's probably `+http://localhost:3000+`.

=== Using Figwheel (Leiningen-only)

WARNING: This has been deprecated in favour of using `figwheel-main`. Check out
the instructions in the next section.

You can also use https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel[Figwheel] with CIDER.

. Set up Figwheel as normal, but make sure `:cljsbuild` and `:figwheel` settings are
in the root of your Leiningen project definition.
. Add these to your dev `:dependencies`:
+
[source,clojure]
----
[cider/piggieback "0.4.2"] ; not needed for cider-jack-in-cljs
[figwheel-sidecar "0.5.19"] ; use here whatever the current version of figwheel is
----
+
WARNING: Keep in mind that CIDER does not support versions versions of Piggieback older than 0.4. Make sure that you use a compatible version of Figwheel.
+
. Add this to your dev `:repl-options` (not needed for `cider-jack-in-cljs`):
+
[source,clojure]
----
:nrepl-middleware [cider.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]
----
+
. Start the REPL with `cider-jack-in-cljs` (kbd:[C-c C-x (C-)j (C-)s]). Select
`figwheel` when prompted for the ClojureScript REPL type.
. Open a browser to the Figwheel URL so that it can connect to your application.

You should also check out
https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Using-the-Figwheel-REPL-within-NRepl[Figwheel's wiki].

=== Using Figwheel-main

NOTE: The instructions here assume you're using Leiningen. Adapting
them to your favourite build tool is up to you.

You can also use https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main[Figwheel-main] with CIDER.

==== Leiningen figwheel-main setup

NOTE: This setup is only necessary if `cider-inject-dependencies-at-jack-in` has
been changed from its default setting of `enabled`, as described more fully above.

. Add this to your dev `:dependencies` (not needed for `cider-jack-in-cljs`):
+
[source,clojure]
----
[cider/piggieback "0.4.2"]
----
+
. Add this to your dev `:repl-options` (not needed for `cider-jack-in-cljs`):
+
[source,clojure]
----
:nrepl-middleware [cider.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]
----
+
. Start the REPL with `cider-jack-in-cljs` (kbd:[C-c C-x (C-)j (C-)s]). When CIDER prompts about the ClojureScript REPL type,
select `figwheel-main`.
. Select the Figwheel build to run when prompted for it. (e.g. `:dev`).

==== Clojure CLI figwheel-main setup

. Ensure your `deps.edn` contains these dependencies available from an
alias such as `fig`. These should already be present if you used the
https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main-template[figwheel-main-template]
with https://github.com/seancorfield/clj-new[clj-new] to generate your
deps.edn.
+
[source,clojure]
----
{ :aliases {:fig {:extra-deps
                 {com.bhauman/rebel-readline-cljs {:mvn/version "0.1.4"}
                  com.bhauman/figwheel-main {:mvn/version "0.2.3"}}}}}
----
+
. Add this option to your project's `.dir-locals.el` before opening the
ClojureScript file in a buffer from which you'll be starting the REPL.
(If the file is already open you can either close and open it again or
use `revert-buffer`.)
+
[source,lisp]
----
((clojurescript-mode . ((cider-clojure-cli-global-options . "-A:fig"))))
----
+
. Start the REPL with `cider-jack-in-cljs` (kbd:[C-c C-x (C-)j (C-)s]).

NOTE: If you didn't setup `.dir-locals.el` you can edit the command-line
in the minibuffer and insert "-A:fig" at the beginning after the `clojure`
executable. To do this prepend calling `cider-jack-in-cljs` with the
universal argument (e.g. C-u).

. When CIDER prompts for the ClojureScript REPL type, select `figwheel-main`.
. When CIDER prompts for the build name, select one of the build name
options which were generated by finding files named <build>.cljs.edn in
the project root directory.

WARNING: If instead of selecting one of the build name options provided,
you enter either a non-existent build name (no matching .cljs.edn file)
or an empty build name, CIDER will forward that on to figwheel-main which
will report an error.

NOTE: For more advanced usage, you can provide any options supported
by `figwheel.main/start` at either the prompt for the build name or
using the `cider-figwheel-main-default-options`.
See https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main/blob/master/src/figwheel/main/api.clj[figwheel.main.api/start]
for details.

=== Using shadow-cljs

Provided you've configured your project correctly, you can simply use
`cider-jack-in-cljs` for `shadow-cljs`.

This will automatically start the shadow-cljs server and connect to
it. You'll also be prompted for the build to use.

Alternatively you can start the server manually with something like:

[source,sh]
----
$ npx shadow-cljs server
----

And connect to it with `cider-connect`.

If you already have a running server watching a build (for instance
you have already run `npx shadow-cljs watch :dev`), you can use the
`shadow-select` CLJS REPL and specify `:dev` when prompted.

== Working with `.cljc` files

Ordinarily, CIDER dispatches code from `clj` files to Clojure REPLs
and `cljs` files to ClojureScript REPLs. But``cljc`` files have two
possible connection targets, both of which are valid. So, by default,
CIDER tries to evaluate `cljc` files in all matching connection
buffers, both `clj` and `cljs`, if present.

Thus, if you're evaluating the code `(+ 2 2)` in a `cljc` file and you
have both an active Clojure and ClojureScript REPL then the code is
going to be evaluated twice, once in each of the REPLs.  In fact, you
can create multiple clj and cljs sibling connections (kbd:[C-c C-x C-s C-s/j]) within a CIDER session and evaluation will be directed
into all REPLs simultaneously. See xref:usage/managing_connections.adoc[Managing
Connections] for more details.
