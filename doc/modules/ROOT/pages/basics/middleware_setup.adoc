= nREPL Middleware Setup
:experimental:

NOTE: You can skip this section if you don't plan to use `cider-connect` or don't care
about the advanced functionality that requires `cider-nrepl`.

Much of CIDER's functionality depends on its own https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl[nREPL
middleware]. Starting
with version 0.11, `cider-jack-in` (kbd:[C-c C-x (C-)j (C-)j])
automatically injects this middleware and other dependencies as required.

NOTE: In the past, if you were setting up CIDER, you might have had to
modify `profiles.clj` or `profile.boot`. CIDER now handles
everything automatically and you don't need to add anything
special to these files. The same is true of your `deps.edn` file.

If you prefer a standalone REPL, you will need to invoke
`cider-connect` instead of `cider-jack-in` and manually add the
dependencies to your Clojure project (explained in the following
sections).

== Setting Up a Standalone REPL

=== Using Leiningen

NOTE: Make sure you're using Leiningen 2.9.0 or newer, as 2.9.0 is the first
release to ship with nREPL 0.6.

Use the convenient plugin for defaults, either in your project's
`project.clj` file or in the :repl profile in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`.

[source,clojure]
----
:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "x.y.z"]
          [mx.cider/enrich-classpath "x.y.z"]]
----

https://github.com/clojure-emacs/enrich-classpath[enrich-classpath] is a library (and Leiningen plugin) that, as its main feature, automatically downloads all available `.jars` with Java sources and javadocs for a given project, so that various tools (e.g. CIDER) can access it. Simply put - it allows you to navigate to Java sources and
javadocs in your Clojure projects.

NOTE: `enrich-classpath` has a bit of a startup cost associated with it, the first time Java sources and javadocs are fetched. It can be turned
off by setting `cider-enrich-classpath` to `nil`.

A minimal `profiles.clj` for CIDER would be:

[source,clojure]
----
{:repl {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.27.2"]
                  [mx.cider/enrich-classpath "1.6.2"]]}}
----

WARNING: Be careful not to place this in the `:user` profile, as this way CIDER's
middleware will always get loaded, causing `lein` to start slower.  You really
need it just for `lein repl` and this is what the `:repl` profile is for.

=== Using Boot

NOTE: Make sure you're using Boot 2.8.3 or newer, as 2.8.3 is the first
release to ship with nREPL 0.6.

Boot users can configure the tool to include the middleware automatically in
all of their projects using a `~/.boot/profile.boot` file like so:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'boot.repl)

(swap! boot.repl/*default-dependencies*
       concat '[[cider/cider-nrepl "0.25.2"]])

(swap! boot.repl/*default-middleware*
       conj 'cider.nrepl/cider-middleware)
----

=== Using tools.deps

You can add the following aliases to your deps.edn in order to launch
a standalone Clojure(Script) nREPL server with CIDER middleware from
the commandline with something like `clj -A:cider-clj`. Then from emacs
run `cider-connect` or `cider-connect-cljs`.

[source,clojure]
----
  :cider-clj {:extra-deps {cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.22.4"}}
              :main-opts ["-m" "nrepl.cmdline" "--middleware" "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]"]}

  :cider-cljs {:extra-deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.339"}
                            cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.22.4"}
                            cider/piggieback {:mvn/version "0.5.1"}}
               :main-opts ["-m" "nrepl.cmdline" "--middleware"
                           "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware,cider.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]"]}

=== Using Maven

== Using Embedded nREPL Server

If you're embedding nREPL in your application, you'll have to start the
server with CIDER's own nREPL handler.

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-app
  (:require [nrepl.server :as nrepl-server]
            [cider.nrepl :refer (cider-nrepl-handler)]))

(defn -main
  []
  (nrepl-server/start-server :port 7888 :handler cider-nrepl-handler))
----

It goes without saying that your project should depend on `cider-nrepl`.

NOTE: Prior to CIDER 0.18, CIDER and cider-nrepl were always released together
and their versions had to match for things to work (e.g. CIDER 0.15 required
cider-nrepl 0.15). But as the prominence of cider-nrepl grew and many other
tools started using it, the two projects evolved separately and are no longer in
tight lock-step. Usually, any recent version of cider-nrepl should be (mostly)
compatible with a recent version of CIDER. You can check the required version of
cider-nrepl for your version of CIDER by looking at
`cider-required-middleware-version`.
