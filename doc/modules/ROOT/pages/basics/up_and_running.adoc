= Up and Running
:experimental:

To use CIDER, you'll need to connect it to a running nREPL server that
is associated with your program. Most Clojure developers use standard
build tooling such as Leiningen, Boot, or Gradle, and CIDER can
automatically work with those tools to get you up and running
quickly. But those tools are not required; CIDER can connect to an
nREPL server that is already started and is managed separately.

NOTE: CIDER will automatically work with Leiningen 2.9.0+ or Boot
2.8.3+. Older versions are not supported.

There are two ways to connect CIDER to an nREPL server:

. CIDER can launch an nREPL server for your project from Emacs.
. You can connect CIDER to an already-running nREPL server, managed separately.

The following sections describe each of these methods.

== Launch an nREPL Server From Emacs

If you have a Clojure project in your file system and want CIDER to
launch an nREPL session for it, simply visit a file that belongs to
the project, and type kbd:[M-x] `cider-jack-in`
kbd:[RET].footnote:[Yeah, that's a "Neuromancer" reference.]
CIDER will start an nREPL server and automatically connect to it.

TIP: In Clojure(Script) buffers the command `cider-jack-in` is bound to kbd:[C-c C-x (C-)j (C-)j].

The process of jacking-in is pretty simple:

* CIDER shells out and runs a command like `lein repl :headless`.
* CIDER waits for the nREPL server to start.
CIDER figures out this by parsing the output from the command and waiting for a line like
`nREPL server started on port 53005 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:53005` to appear there.
* CIDER extracts the port of the nREPL from the preceding message.
* It connects to the running nREPL server.

TIP: You can see the exact command that `cider-jack-in` invoked in your minibuffer, while
waiting for nREPL to start. You can also find this command in Emacs's `+*Messages*+` buffer.

=== Auto-Injecting Dependencies

While CIDER's core functionality requires nothing more than an nREPL server,
there are many advanced features that depend on the presence of additional
nREPL middleware. In the early versions of CIDER (up to CIDER 0.11) users had
to add those dependencies themselves, which was a painful and error-prone process.
Fortunately today that's handled auto-magically when you're using `cider-jack-in`.

If your project uses `lein`, `boot` or `tools.deps` (`deps.edn`), CIDER will
automatically inject all the necessary nREPL dependencies (e.g. `cider-nrepl` or
`piggieback`) when it starts the server.  The injection process is extremely
simple - CIDER simply passes the extra dependencies and nREPL configuration to
your build tool in the command it runs to start the nREPL server. Here's how
this looks for `tools.deps`:

  $ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {nrepl {:mvn/version "0.6.0"} cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.22.4"}}}' -m nrepl.cmdline --middleware '["cider.nrepl/cider-middleware"]'

TIP: If you don't want `cider-jack-in` to inject dependencies automatically, set
`cider-inject-dependencies-at-jack-in` to `nil`. Note that you'll have to setup
the dependencies yourself (see xref:basics/middleware_setup.adoc[nREPL Middleware Setup]),
just as in CIDER 0.10 and older.

Normally `cider-jack-in` would inject only `cider-nrepl` and `cider-jack-in-cljs` would
add `piggieback` as well. The injection mechanism is configurable and
you can easily add more libraries there. Some CIDER extensions would use
this mechanism to auto-inject their own dependencies.

CIDER would also inject the most recent version of nREPL that it supports. This is a simple
trick to override the version of nREPL bundled with your build tool, so you can gain
access to the newest nREPL features. Generally that's one aspect of CIDER's inner workings
that end-users will rarely have to think about.

CIDER can also inject a Clojure dependency into your project, which is useful,
for example, if your project defaults to an older version of Clojure than that
supported by the CIDER middleware. Set `cider-jack-in-auto-inject-clojure`
appropriately to enable this.

NOTE: CIDER does not currently support
dependency auto-injection for Gradle projects. Unfortunately there's no
way to pass extra dependencies to Gradle via its command-line interface.

=== Jacking-in without a Project

If you try to run `cider-jack-in` outside a project
directory, CIDER will warn you and ask you to confirm whether you
really want to do this; more often than not, this is an accident.  If
you decide to proceed, CIDER will invoke the command configured in
`cider-jack-in-default`. Prior to CIDER 0.17, this defaulted to `lein`
but was subsequently switched to `clj`, Clojure's basic startup command.

TIP: You can set `cider-allow-jack-in-without-project` to `t` if you'd like to
disable the warning displayed when jacking-in outside a project.

=== Customizing the Jack-in Command Behaviour

You can use kbd:[C-u M-x] `cider-jack-in` kbd:[RET] to
specify the exact command that `cider-jack-in` would run.
This option is very useful is you want to specify a something like a `lein`
or `deps.edn` profile.

Alternatively you can kbd:[C-u C-u M-x] `cider-jack-in` kbd:[RET], which is a
variation of the previous command. This command will first prompt you for the
project you want to launch `cider-jack-in` in, which is pretty handy if you're
in some other directory currently. This option is also useful if your project
contains some combination of project.clj, build.boot and deps.edn and you want
to launch a REPL for one or the other.

NOTE: The examples use only `cider-jack-in`, but this behaviour is consistent
for all `cider-jack-in-*` commands.

You can further customize the command line CIDER uses for `cider-jack-in` by
modifying the following string options:

* `cider-lein-global-options`, `cider-boot-global-options`,
`cider-clojure-cli-global-options`, `cider-gradle-global-options`:
these are passed to the command directly, in first position
(e.g., `-o` to `lein` enables offline mode).
* `cider-lein-parameters`, `cider-boot-parameters`,
`cider-clojure-cli-parameters`, `cider-gradle-parameters`: these are
usually task names and their parameters (e.g., `dev` for launching
boot's dev task instead of the standard `repl -s wait`).

To use `cider-jack-in` with `tools.deps` on Windows set the
`cider-clojure-cli-command` to `"powershell"`. This happens by default
if you are on Windows and no `clojure` executable is found. Using
`"powershell"` will Base64 encode the clojure launch command before
passing it to PowerShell and avoids shell-escaping issues.

== Connect to a Running nREPL Server

If you have an nREPL server already running, CIDER can connect to
it. For instance, if you have a Leiningen-based project, go to your
project's directory in a terminal session and type:

[source,sh]
----
$ lein repl :headless
----

This will start the project's nREPL server.

If your project uses `boot`, do this instead:

[source,sh]
----
$ boot repl -s wait (or whatever task launches a repl)
----

It is also possible for plain `clj`, although the command is somewhat longer:

[source,sh]
----
$ clj -Sdeps '{:deps {cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.21.1"}}}' -m nrepl.cmdline --middleware "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]"
----

Alternatively, you can start nREPL either manually or using the facilities
provided by your project's build tool (Gradle, Maven, etc).

After you get your nREPL server running, go back to Emacs and connect
to it: kbd:[M-x] `cider-connect` kbd:[RET]. CIDER will
prompt you for the host and port information, which should have been
printed when the previous commands started the nREPL server in your
project.

TIP: In Clojure(Script) buffers the command `cider-connect` is bound to kbd:[C-c C-x c s].

If you frequently connect to the same hosts and ports, you can tell
CIDER about them and it will use the information to do completing
reads for the host and port prompts when you invoke
`cider-connect`. You can identify each host with an optional label.

[source,lisp]
----
(setq cider-known-endpoints
  '(("host-a" "10.10.10.1" "7888")
    ("host-b" "7888")))
----

== Working with Remote Hosts

While most of the time you'd be connecting to a locally running nREPL
server, that was started manually or via `cider-jack-in-*`, there's
also the option to connect to remote nREPL hosts. For the sake of security
CIDER has the ability to tunnel a connection over SSH in such cases.
This behavior is controlled by
`nrepl-use-ssh-fallback-for-remote-hosts`: when true, CIDER will attempt to
connect via ssh to remote hosts when unable to connect directly. It's
`nil` by default.

There's also `nrepl-force-ssh-for-remote-hosts` which will force the use
of ssh for remote connection unconditionally.

WARNING: As nREPL connections are insecure by default you're encouraged to use only SSH
tunneling when connecting to servers running outside of your network.

There's a another case in which CIDER may optionally leverage the `ssh` command - when
trying to figure out potential target hosts and ports when you're doing `cider-connect-*`.
If  `cider-infer-remote-nrepl-ports` is true, CIDER will use ssh to try to infer
nREPL ports on remote hosts (for a direct connection). That option is also set to `nil`
by default.

NOTE: Enabling either of these causes CIDER to use
https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/[TRAMP] for some SSH operations, which parses
config files such as `~/.ssh/config` and `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. This is known to
cause problems with complex or nonstandard ssh configs.

You can safely run `cider-jack-in-*` while working with remote files over TRAMP. CIDER
will handle this use-case transparently for you.
