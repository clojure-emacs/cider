= Using Krell
:experimental:

https://github.com/vouch-opensource/krell[Krell] is the newest
ClojureScript React Native REPL. In this section we'll discuss how to
set it up and use it together with CIDER.

== Installing Krell

To use Krell, specify it as a dependency in your `deps.edn` as per
https://github.com/vouch-opensource/krell/wiki/Reagent-Tutorial[Krell's own wiki].

== Starting a Krell REPL

=== Using cider-jack-in-cljs

Provided you've configured your project correctly, you can simply use
`cider-jack-in-cljs`:

* Press kbd:[C-c C-x j s] (or do `M-x cider-jack-in-cljs`)
* When prompted for the ClojureScript REPL type to start, select `krell`

This will automatically start the REPL server and connect to it.

You can get rid of the prompts for the REPL type and the target build
by creating a `.dir-locals.el` file with the following contents in the
root of your project.
