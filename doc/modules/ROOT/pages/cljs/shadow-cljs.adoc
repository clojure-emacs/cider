= Using shadow-cljs
:experimental:

`shadow-cljs` is one of the most popular toolchain for doing ClojureScript
development these days. In this section we'll discuss how to set it up and
use it together with CIDER.

== Setting up shadow-cljs

NOTE: This section assumes you've already installed node.js.

Installing `shadow-cljs` is pretty straight-forward. You can do it via `npm` or `yarn`:

  $ npm install -g shadow-cljs
  $ yarn global add shadow-cljs

While it's not necessary to do a global installation that's generally the recommended approach.

== Starting a shadow-cljs REPL

=== Using cider-jack-in-cljs

Provided you've configured your project correctly, you can simply use
`cider-jack-in-cljs`:

* Press kbd:[C-c C-x j s] (or do `M-x cider-jack-in-cljs`)
* When prompted for the ClojureScript REPL type to start, select `shadow`

This will automatically start the shadow-cljs server and connect to
it. You'll also be prompted for the shadow-cljs build to use. Select
your desired build (e.g. `app`) and you should see something like:

  shadow.user> To quit, type: :cljs/quit
  [:selected :app]
  cljs.repl>

NOTE: CIDER will extract the list of available builds automatically
from the `shadow-cljs.edn` file in the root of the current project.

You can get rid of the prompts for the REPL type and the target build
by creating a `.dir-locals.el` file with the following contents in the
root of your project.

[source,clojure]
----
((nil . ((cider-default-cljs-repl . shadow)
         (cider-shadow-default-options . "<your-build-name-here>"))))
----

=== Using cider-connect-cljs

Alternatively you can start the server manually with something like:

[source,sh]
----
$ npx shadow-cljs server
----

And connect to it with `cider-connect`.

NOTE: If https://docs.cider.mx/cider-nrepl/[cider-nrepl] isn't in your
classpath you should make sure it's there. You can do this by adding
it to `:dependencies` in the `shadow-cljs.edn` configuration file
residing in the root of your project. Alternatively you can set
`cider-repl-auto-detect-type` to `nil`, as the auto-detection of
REPL types doesn't work without `cider-nrepl`.

If you already have a running server watching a build (for instance
you have already run `npx shadow-cljs watch :dev`), you can use the
`shadow-select` CLJS REPL and specify `:dev` when prompted.

== Configuration

You can tweak the command used by `cider-jack-in-cljs` to start the `shadow-cljs` server
via the following configuration variables:

* `cider-shadow-cljs-command` (its default value is `npx shadow-cljs`)
* `cider-shadow-cljs-global-options` (its default value is blank)
* `cider-shadow-cljs-parameters` (its default value is `server`)

All of this results in the following default command to start the shadow-cljs server:

  $ npx shadow-cljs server

The command is visible in the minibuffer when you're doing `cider-jack-in-cljs`.

As noted earlier you can also set a default build via `cider-shadow-default-options`:

  (setq cider-shadow-default-options "app")
