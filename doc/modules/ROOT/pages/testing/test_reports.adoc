= Interacting with Test Result Reports
:experimental:

Should tests fail then CIDER displays a test result report in the
`+*cider-test-report*+` buffer. This buffer uses `cider-test-report-mode`,
which makes it easy to review any failures that might have occurred
and jump directly to the definition of failing tests.

Calling test commands again will update the test report.

TIP: You can also xref:testing/running_tests.adoc#display-test-report-on-success[configure test reports to be displayed on success].
