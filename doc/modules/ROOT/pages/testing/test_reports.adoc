= Interacting with Test Result Reports
:experimental:

Shoud tests fail then CIDER displays a test result report in the
`+*cider-test-report*+` buffer. This buffer uses `cider-test-report-mode`,
which makes it easy to review any failures that might have occurred
and jump directly to the definition of failing tests.

Calling test commands again will update the test report.
