= Using cider-test with Alternative Test Libraries

The `clojure.test` machinery is designed to be pluggable. Any test
library can integrate with it and leverage the `cider-test`
ecosystem.

As a test framework author, supporting the built-in `clojure.test` machinery
(and hence `cider-test`) is pretty straightforward:

. Add `:test` metadata to the vars corresponding to the test
functions. The `clojure-test` machinery uses this metadata to
find tests.
. Implement the `clojure.test/report` multimethod to capture the test results.

For example, https://github.com/clojure/test.check[test.check] was designed independently of `clojure.test`
but integrates with it. Because of this, `cider-test` handles
`defspec` just like `deftest`. `test.check` just adds compatibility in this
https://github.com/clojure/test.check/blob/24f74b83f1c7a032f98efdcc1db9d74b3a6a794d/src/main/clojure/clojure/test/check/clojure_test.cljc[namespace].

== Supported Libraries

* [test-check]
* https://github.com/clojure-expectations/expectations[clojure-expectations] added
support for `clojure.test` in version 2.2 and should also work with CIDER.
* https://github.com/jimpil/fudje[fudje]

== Midje Support

NOTE: Emidje is a third-party extension that's not bundled with CIDER.

https://github.com/nubank/emidje[Emidje] is a test runner, report
viewer and formatting tool for
https://github.com/marick/Midje[Midje] within Emacs.

Emidje extends CIDER to provide support for Midje tests in a similar
fashion as `cider-test.el` does for clojure.test tests. In fact, most of
Emidje's functionalities were strongly inspired by `cider-test.el`
features.
