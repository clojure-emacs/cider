The idea of interactive programming is at the very heart of CIDER.

Programmers are expected to program in a very dynamic and incremental manner,
constantly re-evaluating existing Clojure definitions and adding new ones to
their running applications. You never stop/start a Clojure application while
using CIDER - you're constantly interacting with it and changing it.

CIDER comes with a handy minor mode called `cider-mode` (complementing
`clojure-mode`) that allows you to evaluate code in your Clojure source
files and load it directly in the REPL. `cider-mode` is the primary
way you're supposed to be interacting with your REPL process. If you
want to get productive with CIDER, you'll have to get intimately familiar
with it.

### Using cider-mode

Here's a list of `cider-mode`'s keybindings:

 Keyboard shortcut                    | Description
--------------------------------------|-------------------------------
<kbd>C-x C-e</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd>| Evaluate the form preceding point and display the result in the echo area and/or in an buffer overlay (according to `cider-use-overlays`).  If invoked with a prefix argument, insert the result into the current buffer.
<kbd>C-c C-w</kbd>                   | Evaluate the form preceding point and replace it with its result.
<kbd>C-c M-e</kbd>                   | Evaluate the form preceding point and output it result to the REPL buffer.  If invoked with a prefix argument, takes you to the REPL buffer after being invoked.
<kbd>C-c M-p</kbd>                   | Load the form preceding point in the REPL buffer.
<kbd>C-c C-p</kbd>                   | Evaluate the form preceding point and pretty-print the result in a popup buffer.
<kbd>C-c C-f</kbd>                   | Evaluate the top level form under point and pretty-print the result in a popup buffer.
<kbd>C-M-x</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>  | Evaluate the top level form under point and display the result in the echo area.
<kbd>C-u C-M-x</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-u C-c C-c</kbd>  | Debug the top level form under point and walk through its evaluation
<kbd>C-c C-r</kbd>                   | Evaluate the region and display the result in the echo area.
<kbd>C-c C-b</kbd>                   | Interrupt any pending evaluations.
<kbd>C-c C-m</kbd>                   | Invoke `macroexpand-1` on the form at point and display the result in a macroexpansion buffer.  If invoked with a prefix argument, `macroexpand` is used instead of `macroexpand-1`.
<kbd>C-c M-m</kbd>                   | Invoke `clojure.walk/macroexpand-all` on the form at point and display the result in a macroexpansion buffer.
<kbd>C-c C-n</kbd>                   | Eval the ns form.
<kbd>C-c M-n</kbd>                   | Switch the namespace of the REPL buffer to the namespace of the current buffer.
<kbd>C-c C-z</kbd>                   | Switch to the relevant REPL buffer. Use a prefix argument to change the namespace of the REPL buffer to match the currently visited source file.
<kbd>C-u C-u C-c C-z</kbd>           | Switch to the REPL buffer based on a user prompt for a directory.
<kbd>C-c M-z</kbd>         | Load (eval) the current buffer and switch to the relevant REPL buffer. Use a prefix argument to change the namespace of the REPL buffer to match the currently visited source file.
<kbd>C-c M-d</kbd>                   | Display default REPL connection details, including project directory name, buffer namespace, host and port.
<kbd>C-c M-r</kbd>                   | Rotate and display the default nREPL connection.
<kbd>C-c C-o</kbd>                   | Clear the last output in the REPL buffer. With a prefix argument it will clear the entire REPL buffer, leaving only a prompt. Useful if you're running the REPL buffer in a side by side buffer.
<kbd>C-c C-k</kbd>                   | Load (eval) the current buffer.
<kbd>C-c C-l</kbd>                   | Load (eval) a Clojure file.
<kbd>C-c C-x</kbd>                   | Reload all modified files on the classpath. If invoked with a prefix argument, reload all files on the classpath. If invoked with a double prefix argument, clear the state of the namespace tracker before reloading.
<kbd>C-c C-d d</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-d C-d</kbd> | Display doc string for the symbol at point.  If invoked with a prefix argument, or no symbol is found at point, prompt for a symbol.
<kbd>C-c C-d j</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-d C-j</kbd> | Display JavaDoc (in your default browser) for the symbol at point.  If invoked with a prefix argument, or no symbol is found at point, prompt for a symbol.
<kbd>C-c C-d r</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-d C-r</kbd> | Lookup symbol in Grimoire.
<kbd>C-c C-d a</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-d C-a</kbd> | Apropos search for functions/vars.
<kbd>C-c C-d f</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-d C-f</kbd> | Apropos search for documentation.
<kbd>C-c M-i</kbd>                   | Inspect expression. Will act on expression at point if present.
<kbd>C-c M-t v</kbd>                 | Toggle var tracing.
<kbd>C-c M-t n</kbd>                 | Toggle namespace tracing.
<kbd>C-c C-u</kbd>                   | Undefine a symbol. If invoked with a prefix argument, or no symbol is found at point, prompt for a symbol.

<kbd>C-c C-t p</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-t C-p</kbd> | Run tests for all project namespaces. This loads the additional namespaces.
<kbd>C-c C-t r</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-t C-r</kbd> | Re-run test failures/errors.
<kbd>C-c C-t b</kbd> <br/> <kbd>C-c C-t C-b</kbd> | Show the test report buffer.
<kbd>M-.</kbd>                       | Jump to the definition of a symbol.  If invoked with a prefix argument, or no symbol is found at point, prompt for a symbol.
<kbd>C-c M-.</kbd>                   | Jump to the resource referenced by the string at point.
<kbd>C-c C-.</kbd>                   | Jump to some namespace on the classpath.
<kbd>M-,</kbd>                       | Return to your pre-jump location.
<kbd>M-TAB</kbd>                     | Complete the symbol at point.
<kbd>C-c C-q</kbd>                   | Quit the current nREPL connection. With a prefix argument it will quit all connections.

There's no need to memorize this list. In any Clojure buffer with `cider-mode`
active you'll have a CIDER menu available, which lists all the most important
commands and their keybindings. You can also invoke `C-h f RET cider-mode` to
get a list of the keybindings for `cider-mode`.

An even better solution would be to install [which-key][], which will
automatically show you a list of available keybindings as you start typing some
keys. This will simplify your interactions with CIDER quite a lot (especially in
the beginning). Here's what you'd see if you typed <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> in a
Clojure buffer:
