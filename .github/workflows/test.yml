# This `on:` configuration avoids double-triggered jobs (one for `push`, one for `pull_request`).
# Pull requests will still get jobs on every commit.
# However you won't get jobs on branch pushes that lack an associated pull requests.
# On the other hand, CircleCI jobs will still be triggered, which give a useful form of feedback.
# Lastly, remember that we have a Makefile for local development - you are encouraged to use it before pushing commits.
