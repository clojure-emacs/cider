STACK is a list of so far decoded components of the current message.  Car
of STACK is the innermost incompletely decoded object.  The algorithm pops
this list when inner object was completely decoded or grows it by one when
new list or dict was encountered.

The returned value is of the form (INFO . STACK) where INFO is
:stub, nil, :end or :eob and STACK is either an incomplete parsing state as
above (INFO is :stub, nil or :eob) or a list of one component representing
the completely decoded message (INFO is :end).  INFO is nil when an
elementary non-root object was successfully decoded.  INFO is :end when this
object is a root list or dict."
